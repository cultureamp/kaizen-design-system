# Overview

<br/>

## Caveat before use
This is an early release of the Kaizen Tailwind Preset - the API may change and evolve as we receive feedback from our teams. We will endeavour to assist where possible if classes or utilities are updated in the future.

## What our package does
The `@kaizen/tailwind` package is essentially a custom Tailwind preset. For more information about Tailwind presets, see their docs [here](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/presets). This package does not change how Tailwind works; it only changes the suffixes that can be attached to utilities.  
In the following diagram, the modifier `md:` and the utility `font-` are part of Tailwind. The suffix `family-heading` is defined by our preset, and represents one of our font-family design tokens.
