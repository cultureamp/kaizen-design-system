# Welcome to the Kaizen Component Library V1

Kaizen aims to provide standard components which enable teams to build UI as efficiently as possibe while maintaining a high level of quality, accessibility and consistency with thle overall platform.

To achieve this, Kaizen provides a set of React components and tokens which represent the foundations of any UI (colours, spacing, font sizes etc). We aim to have what's represeted here in code equally matching Figma, to enable cross-functional teams to communicate with the same language and ease of translation from design to code.

## Getting started

You can find a comprehensive overview of how to get your code base started on our [Github page](https://github.com/cultureamp/kaizen-design-system#getting-started).

## Support
