# Welcome to the Kaizen Component Library

Kaizen aims to provide standard components which enable teams to build UI as efficiently as possibe while maintaining a high level of quality, accessibility and consistency with thle overall platform.

To achieve this, Kaizen provides a set of React components and tokens which represent the foundations of any UI (colours, spacing, font sizes etc.). We aim to have what's represeted here in code equally matching Figma, to enable cross-functional teams to communicate with the same language and ease of translation from design to code.

## Getting started

You can find a comprehensive overview of how to get your code base started on our [Github page](https://github.com/cultureamp/kaizen-design-system#getting-started).

We have 4 main sections:
- Components: React components you can use in your Apps
- Helpers: Any hooks or utilities we provide
- Design tokens: Primarily used for creating new components that don't already exist.
- Deprecated: components which are on their way out. (Find out more on the [Component Health page](https://cultureamp.design/component-health/))


## Support

The Kaizen Design System Team is here to support the usage of the library via #prod_design_system channel on Slack.

Here's a few things to reach out to us for *before contribution*:
- Any bugs with the existing components
- A missing feature in a component
- Trouble finding something
