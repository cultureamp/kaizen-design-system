# App starter

This guide is all about how to introduce the Kaizen Design System to your app.

Whilst the Kaizen Design System mainly focuses on the more atomic components in your app, some of the components have a high level of complexity requiring various global components to be present in order for them to function.

<Unstyled>
  <InlineNotification persistent type="informative">
    {
      <>
        You won&apos;t need to apply any of the below if you have the latest{' '}
        <a href="https://github.com/cultureamp/next-template">next-template</a>.
      </>
    }
  </InlineNotification>
</Unstyled>

## 1. Add the KaizenProvider

The <LinkTo pageId="components-kaizen-provider-installation">KaizenProvider</LinkTo> feeds your entire app with Kaizen defaults so it's important that it goes at the very root of your application.

```tsx
import { KaizenProvider } from '@kaizen/components'
;<KaizenProvider>
  <App />
</KaizenProvider>
```

Be sure to read the <LinkTo pageId="components-kaizen-provider-installation">KaizenProvider</LinkTo> documentation for migration tips and in case your app requires any further config, but generally this should be it!

## 2. Add unified-home's @culturamp/i18n-react-intl webpack plugin to your webpack config

This plugin is necessary for KaizenProvider to run properly, and for ensuring that Kaizen's internal translated message strings are
available to the Kaizen components that consume them.

For installation instructions, see their docs [here](https://github.com/cultureamp/unified-home/tree/master/packages/i18n-react-intl#integrating-with-webpack).

## 3. Setup Tailwind CSS

It is recommended that you use Tailwind for any custom CSS you may need to write outside of using Kaizen components.

For full installation instructions, see the <LinkTo pageId="systems-tailwind-getting-started">Tailwind Getting Started</LinkTo> page.

Whether or not you are already familiar with Tailwind, you'll want to take a look at our <LinkTo pageId="systems-tailwind-utility-class-references-overview">Utility Class References</LinkTo>, as we have made distinct modifications to vanilla Tailwind to suit our design system.

## 4. Add Kaizen's global CSS stylesheet

For the convenience of your app, we've compiled all the necessary styles for our components into a single stylesheet to make it easy to set and forget.

This includes:

- CSS variables (design tokens)
- [Normalize.css](https://github.com/necolas/normalize.css)
- Font assets
- reset.css
- Component styles

Add this stylesheet at the top of your global styles imports of your app.

Note: If you are using Storybook, you will also need to add it in your `preview.ts`.

```js
import '@kaizen/components/dist/styles.css'
import 'tailwind.css'
```

## 5. Link to Google Material Symbols CDN

_Note that this step is required as long as you use any Kaizen component that contains an Icon, not just if you use (next) Icon directly._

Our <LinkTo pageId="illustrations-icon-icon-next-api-specification">(Next) Icons</LinkTo> (introduced in `@kaizen/components@1.67.0`) are sourced from [Google Material Symbols](https://fonts.google.com/icons).
You will need to add the following to your Storybook `preview-head.html` and to the `<head>` of your apps.

```html
<link rel="preconnect" href="https://fonts.gstatic.com/" crossorigin />
<link
  rel="preload"
  as="style"
  href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Material+Symbols+Outlined:opsz,wght,FILL,GRAD@20..48,400,0..1,0&display=block"
/>
<link
  rel="stylesheet"
  href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Material+Symbols+Outlined:opsz,wght,FILL,GRAD@20..48,400,0..1,0&display=block"
/>
```
