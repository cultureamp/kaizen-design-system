# Migration to v2

Overall version 2 **does not change** any existing Tailwind API, however it now has a pre-requisite on an external resource for the features to work.

## Pre-requisites
- `@kaizen/reset.css` ([manual installation instructions](https://cultureamp.design/?path=/docs/guides-app-starter--docs#3-add-kaizens-global-css-stylesheets) Or you can update your `next-template`)

## Key change

v2 Adds DEFAULT values to `borderWidth` and `borderColor` in the Tailwind preset, so these don't need to be written with utility classes.
These changes mean that border styles require much less utility classes to be written.

For example, to add a border-bottom to an element, v1 would previously need to write:
```html
<div className="border-b-default border-l-none border-r-none border-t-none border-solid border-purple-800"></div>
```

We can now achieve the same css in v2 by simply writing:
```html
<div className="border-b"></div>
```
