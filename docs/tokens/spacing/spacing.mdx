# Spacing

## Naming convention

Kaizen's spacing tokens use pixel values to reference equivalent rem values. For example, the spacing token `16` refers to `1rem`, because `16px` = `1rem`.

## Reasoning

Engineers need to use `rem` when spacing for accessibility reasons. However, Figma does not allow `rem` values when creating designs. This approach allows engineers to recieve pixel values from a designer, and write code in terms of pixel values without having to calculate what the corresponding `rem` value would be.

## Implementation

Kaizen's spacing tokens are easily available through our [Tailwind package](/story/systems-tailwind-overview--page).

For example, if a design specifies a `div` with a margin-right of `12px`, the spacing token `12` can be applied to Tailwind's `mr-` utility class.

In Tailwind, spacing tokens can be applied to the following core modules:
[padding](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/padding), [margin](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/margin), [width](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/width), [height](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/height), [maxHeight](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/max-height#setting-the-maximum-height), [gap](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/gap), [space](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/space), [translate](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/translate)
