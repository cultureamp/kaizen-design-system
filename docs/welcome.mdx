# Welcome

The Kaizen Design System is a Multi-Tier system which enables Product Teams to efficiently build high quality and platform cohesive user interfaces.

## What makes up the Design System?
It's the term that encompasses everything, including all of the Tier's React and Figma Libraries, governance and guidelines for usage.

Each Tier has its purpose and allows for different degree's of flexibility:

- Tier 1: Universal tokens, components, patterns
- Tier 2: Existing Kaizen components and patterns
- Tier 3: Domain specific libraries (hosted in Product Team repo's)

## What's in this Storybook?

This storybook contains everything which the Design System Team owns, which is Culture Amp's source of truth for Tier 1, Tier 2 and some engineering specific utility components.
