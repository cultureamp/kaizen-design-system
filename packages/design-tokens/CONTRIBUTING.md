## Before releasing a PR

When updating any .json files, you must run `yarn build` from within this directory and commit the artefacts prior to releasing a PR: this will automatically generate scss and less files. Make sure you have run `yarn install` (or simply `yarn`) from the root of the kaizen-design-system repo prior to running this.
