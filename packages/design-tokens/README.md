# Kaizen Tokens

Design tokens for all platforms.

## About

Design tokens are named and stored visual design traits, including colors, typography, and animation timings. Design Tokens are the heart of every Design System.

The tokens represented here are platform-agnostic (JSON), as this will help us contribute to & facilitate the maintenance of living style guides. This package defines all the option tokens in Kaizen.

- **Option tokens** offer options. For example, `$color-purple-500: #898ba9;` is one color option available.
- **Decision tokens** communicate decisions about when to apply an option token to a context. For example, the color used for text is a decision.

In its current state this package supports Sass and Less variables, generated from a JSON tokens file.

**Please note** that the helpers in this package are specifically for accessing and using these design tokens. Component-specific helpers are best suited for kaizen-component-library.

As of V3, design tokens are also **themable**; they are intended to be used as if they can be **switched at runtime**. Because of this, we employ [CSS Variables](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Using_CSS_custom_properties)
to support this feature, so when consuming tokens in SASS/LESS you should assume they will contain values such as `var(--color-...)`, rather than concrete values such as `1.5rem` or `#fff`.
These values are supplied by the ThemeManager.



## Installation

```sh
yarn add @kaizen/design-tokens
```

## Usage

### Sass

```scss
## Note helper functions are provided
@import "~@kaizen/design-tokens/sass/[color/depth/layout/spacing/typography/helpers]";
```

### Less

```less
## Note helper functions are provided
@import "~@kaizen/design-tokens/less/[color/depth/layout/spacing/typography/helpers]";
```

### JavaScript

```js
import * as tokens from @kaizen/design-tokens/tokens/[color/depth/layout/spacing/typography]
```

## Where possible, we keep things unitless.

When adding support for another target the transformation should add the appropriate unit to the artefact. For example, converting typography sizes to Sass/Less should add REM.

### Web

All values in tokens are represented as rem, em or px.

* Use REMs for sizes and spacing (grid).
* Use EMs for media queries.
* Use px for borders.
