# How to use design tokens

Welcome! This document should serve as an explanation for how to use our design tokens, and the necessary abstractions that come with them.
If you've arrived here as an existing user of design tokens, and are looking to migrate from V2 -> V3, please refer to the [Migrating](#migrating) section.

## What are Kaizen design tokens?
Kaizen's design tokens are a hierarchical set of variables that partly define what our design system *is*. They contain definitions of design system constants related (but not limited) to color, typography, spacing and layout,
but don't define exactly what components should look like, otherwise they would be containing or re-inventing HTML and CSS. 
They are the set of variables that accompany Kaizen components to make them look and feel as consistent as possible, and are available to be consumed in your own compositions.

As of V3, design tokens are also **themable**; they are intended to be used as if they can be **switched at runtime**. Because of this, we employ [CSS Variables](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_variables.asp)
to support this feature, so when consuming tokens in SASS/LESS you should assume they will contain values such as `var(--kz-var-color-...)`, rather than concrete values such as `1.5rem` or `#fff`.

A model is worth 1000 words.

                {JSON.stringify(makeCSSVariableTheme(zenTheme)["kz-var"], null, 2)}
            </pre>
        </Box>
    </Card>
    <div style={{textAlign: "center", padding: "0.5rem"}}>

## Getting started


### Bootstrapping



### Theme Switching

### API

## Migrating
If you're reading this, you're most likely using design tokens either by referring to SASS/LESS variables such as `$kz-color-wisteria-800`, or by importing values through `import { color } from '@kaizen/design-tokens/tokens/color` in JavaScript/TypeScript, and expecting that they hold concrete values such as `#fa0626`.

There are two significant and breaking changes that are occurring as of the next release:

### All token variables `$kz-*` are being renamed to `$kz-var-*`
We would like to perform the migration

### Tokens now contain CSS variables and should be defined on `:root`
