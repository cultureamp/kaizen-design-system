# Getting started

This document should serve as an explanation for how to use our design tokens - `@kaizen/design-tokens` - within your application, and the initial steps you need to take before using them in SASS or React.

## 1. Setup a ThemeManager

<CodeBlock language="typescript" code={
`import { ThemeManager, defaultTheme } from '@kaizen/design-tokens'
export const themeManager = new ThemeManager(defaultTheme);`
} />

* Instantiate a `ThemeManager` with your choice of initial theme. If you're not sure, use the `defaultTheme`.
* There should only be one instance per application (singleton).
* It is responsible for holding the state of the current theme.
* The current theme can be subscribed to using `addThemeChangeListener` so you can be reactive to changes. This is the preferred way to consume tokens in JS/TS.
* Themes are applied to the DOM as a flattened list of CSS variables, so that changes to the current theme are also reflected in CSS (or SASS/LESS)

**Note**: it is important to be aware of the loading order of your application's assets. This code needs to be run *before* any parts of your UI (that depend on CSS variables being defined) are visible. See [Caveats](#caveats).

## 2. Start using design tokens

The recommended approaches to consuming design tokens are to:

* Import their CSS variables representations in SASS - <LinkTo pageId="systems-tokens-how-to-use-design-tokens-in-sass">How to use design tokens in SASS</LinkTo>
* In a React application, use the context and hook components to subscribe and consume the current theme values - <LinkTo pageId="systems-tokens-how-to-use-design-tokens-in-react-components">How to use design tokens in React components</LinkTo>
* Subscribe to the theme using `themeManager.addThemeChangeListener(theme => ...)` and react to changes.


## Caveats

#### Before a ThemeManager has been instantiated, no CSS variables will have been defined on the DOM automatically.

However, **all tokens will automatically work because every CSS variable token will provide a fallback value to the default theme.** See <LinkTo pageId="systems-tokens-api">API</LinkTo>.

This means that any parts of your UI that are loaded before the theme manager (for example HAML blocks) will render initially without CSS variables defined, which can result in a flash of unstyled content, or a visual theme change after the page has loaded.

#### If you can't instantiate a ThemeManager, import a CSS file to apply a theme.

* Add `import "@kaizen/design-tokens/css/default-theme.css"` to your JS/TS source to apply the default theme's CSS variables on the `:root` element.
* Similarly, you can add `<link rel="stylesheet" href="./node_modules/@kaizen/design-tokens/css/default-theme.css">` to your HTML.
