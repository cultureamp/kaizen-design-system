# What are Kaizen design tokens?
Kaizen's design tokens are a hierarchical set of variables that partly define what our design system *is*. They contain definitions of design system constants related (but not limited) to color, typography, spacing and layout,
but don't define exactly what components should look like, otherwise they would be containing or re-inventing HTML and CSS. 
They are the set of variables that accompany Kaizen components to make them look and feel as consistent as possible, and are available to be consumed in your own compositions.


As of V3, design tokens are also **themable**; they are intended to be used as if they can be **switched at runtime**. Because of this, we employ [CSS Variables](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_variables.asp)
to support this feature, so when consuming tokens in SASS/LESS you should assume they will contain values such as `var(--kz-var-color-...)`, rather than concrete values such as `1.5rem` or `#fff`.
