## To keep in mind

*   See the [Icons](/guidelines/) guidelines for more information on icons, including visuals.
*   Meaningful or presentational:
    *   Use **meaningful** icons with `role=img` to convey information, such as drawing attention to an item that might have a problem using a cautionary icon: 
        *   Provide a short `title` and slightly more descriptive `desc` for meaningful icons so the icon is understandable by people using a screen reader.
    *   Use **presentational** icons with `role="presentation"` for icons that do not need to convey information. They might be provided for aesthetic reasons or otherwise have meaning conveyed elsewhere.
*   To control the icon's color, set the color property on the icon's parent element. For example, `color: $kz-color-cluny-500`.
*   For a specific subset of icons, we include a specific icon that has the preferred color baked in, such as the destructive trash icon using Coral. Otherwise, follow the [Icons: Interaction states](https://cultureamp.design/guidelines/icons/#interaction-states) guidelines.

We have a helper class you can compose to utilize these styles:

```
.myButton {
  composes: interactiveIconWrapper from 'cultureamp-style-guide/components/Icon/Icon.module.scss';
}

.myReversedButton {
  composes: reversedInteractiveIconWrapper from 'cultureamp-style-guide/components/Icon/Icon.module.scss';
}
```

## When to use and when not to use
