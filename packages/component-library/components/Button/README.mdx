## To keep in mind

*   All buttons use a button element (not a link element and no `role=”button”`)
*   All buttons have a label:
    *   no more than 2 to 3 words long
    *   use verbs first; use only verbs where possible e.g. “Save”
    *   avoid unnecessary words and articles, such as “the” or “a”
    *   use sentence case
    *   DON’T use long phrases as label
    *   DON’T have finishing punctuation
    *   DON’T have text overflowing across 2 lines—this can sometimes happen when the label is translated from a 3-word English label 
*   All buttons have a large click target of 48px to meet minimum touch target sizes
*   Default action button:
    *   Use this when there is more than 1 button or it is not the most important action on the page
*   Primary action button:
    *   Use only 1 primary action button per page
*   Destructive action button:
    *   Only use when the action will result in data loss, cannot be undone, or otherwise have significant consequences
*   Secondary action button:
    *   Secondary Action Buttons kind of look like links but have lots of padding, a large clickable area, and sit next to other buttons, such as a Primary button. That is, they perform actions and do not navigate.
*   Icon + label (icon on the left):
    *   RTL: flip the direction of arrow icons when the user is using a right-to-left language
*   Label + icon (icon on the right):
    *   RTL: flip the direction of arrow icons when the user is using a right-to-left language
*   Disabled buttons:
    *   See the [Interaction states guidelines for disabled elements](/guidelines/interaction-states#disabled-state).
*   Supplementary information:
    *   You might show additional, optional information on hover and focus using a [Tooltip](/components/tooltip) or [Popover](/components/popover).

## When to use and when not to use

<WhenToUseAndWhenNotToUse>
<WhenToUse>

*   A button indicates to a user that they can perform an action on this page, such as:
    *   Apply an action to an object, e.g. save, delete, add an item, undo, create a new item
    *   Submit a form to send data
    *   Start a new task
    *   Trigger a new element to appear on the page e.g. toggle additional information, open a modal
    *   Trigger the next step in a process

</WhenToUse>
<WhenNotToUse>

*   Don’t use a button when navigation is involved. Instead, use a [link](/guidelines/link-vs-button/).
*   If the button is used to toggle between 2 states, use a [Toggle Switch](/components/toggle-switch-field) instead.
