/// Creates a scaling transition. A scale of `1` means the element is the same size. Larger numbers make the element bigger, while numbers less than 1 make the element smaller.
/// @param {Keyword} $state [in] - State to transition to.
/// @param {Number} $from [null] - Size to start at. By default `0` and `1` for `in` and `out` states respectively.
/// @param {Number} $to [null] - Size to end at. By default `1` and `0` for `in` and `out` states respectively.
/// @param {Boolean} $fade [true] - Set to `true` to fade the element in or out simultaneously.
/// @param {Duration} $duration [null] - Length (speed) of the transition.
/// @param {Keyword|Function} $timing [null] - Easing of the transition.
/// @param {Duration} $delay [null] - Delay in seconds or milliseconds before the transition starts.
