## Options

*   Mood:
    *   Default
    *   Positive
    *   Informative
    *   Cautionary
    *   Negative
*   Border style:
    *   Solid
    *   Dashed
    *   None

## To keep in mind

* There are different Empty States including:
    * **Positive empty state**: nothing is here because everything is working/you’ve completed all tasks.
    * **Informative empty state**: things are happening and there are things to be done but no direct action required.
    * **Action empty state**: we need the user to do something right now.
    * **Neutral empty state**: nothing has happened/we have nothing to show.
    * **Negative empty state**: something didn’t load/we couldn’t find anything.

* They also come in three different sizes for you to use (max, mid, min):
    * For viewports or containers **larger than 1080px**: show an empty pattern that’s 1080px wide (e.g. using max-width: 1080px) using the “large” layout.
    * For viewports or containers **smaller than 720px**: show a responsive, scaling empty pattern (e.g. using max-width: 100%).
    * For viewports or containers **between 300px and 720px**: use the “medium” layout.
    * For viewports or containers **smaller than 300px**: use the “small” layout.

* Call To Actions (CTAs):
    * We use Default Buttons unless it is the only action on the page, then we use Primary Action Buttons (label + icon).
    * If no action is appropriate, don’t show a button. Instead, you might include hyperlinks in the body copy as needed.

* Illustrations:
    * Each type of empty state comes with a standard illustration. Do not mix and match.

* Copy:
    * The **headline** aids scanning: people can take action from this without reading the body.
    * The **body** text adds detail: people get extra value from reading additional detail.
    * The **Call To Action (CTA) button**: people know exactly what to do next. This draws attention to the most logical action, helping people move from the empty state to a situation where the page is useful to them.
    * Each type of empty state suggests different kinds of copy:
        * Positive empty state - Words of affirmation. Create curiosity, enable education, and guide them in the right direction with delight.
        * (TBD) Informative empty state - Keep it brief. Optional opportunity to educate the user.
        * (TBD) Action empty state - Inform users of specific action they need to take. Arm them with the info they need to do that.
        * Neutral empty state - Let people know that nothing is required of them.
        * Negative empty state - See our language guide on errors

## When to use

* Use empty states when you don’t have anything else to show. It is the only content on the page. There might be navigation present in addition to the empty state.  
* You might use a negative empty state for an intentionally negative state where the system is operating correctly and the user has provided accurate information.

## When not to use

* Don’t use empty states to provide feedback about a change in state or context that the user needs to be notified about during a task.
* Don’t use empty states when something negative has happened because the system failed or is a direct result of the user providing bad input.
