## To keep in mind

* Most of the time, we validate text fields on “blur” (when leaving the text fields) or on form submission as needed. We don’t validate on key strokes.
* As a rule of thumb, generally use “ (optional)” to indicate optional fields instead of “`*`” to indicate required fields.
* Consider if a more specific `type` of is needed as an `email` type for email addresses.
* When displaying a validation messages, such as an error, use a `aria-describedby` attribute to associate the text field with the element containing the validation message.
* Pre-fill the field with good defaults wherever possible.

## When to use

* Use Text Fields to gather text input.

## When not to use

* Avoid gathering input from users that isn't absolutely necessary.
