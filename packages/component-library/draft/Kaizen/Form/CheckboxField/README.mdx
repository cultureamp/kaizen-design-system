## To keep in mind

*   Ensure both label and input are clickable to select the checkbox field. That is, use `label` tags that wrap the `input` element or use a `for` attribute.

## When to use

*   For a single opt-in choice: show one checkbox field.

## When not to use

*   For a few options: show two or more checkbox fields in a [Checkbox Group](/components/checkbox-group).
*   Donâ€™t use when there is more than 20 options.
*   When choices are mutually exclusive, use a [radio](/components/radio) instead.
*   For settings that are immediately applied, consider using a [toggle switch](/components/toggle-switch) instead.
