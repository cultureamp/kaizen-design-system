## To keep in mind

*   There must always be more than one radio field used together in a group.
*   Radio Group contains a set of Radios and a Radio Group Label.
*   Show options in a sensible order, such as alphabetical, numeric.
*   Avoid long lists. Chunk long lists and group related options together.
*   The setting only applies when the user takes an action, such as clicking a save button.
*   Use specific, clear, concrete labels.
*   Prefer vertical (stacked) radios to easily scan and compare options.
*   Use a fieldset to group related radio fields together in a set.
*   Offer a default option.
*   Prefer to use a default selected option.
*   Avoid nesting.
*   For Right-To-Left languages, add `dir=”rtl”` to a `div` wrapping the Radios

## When to use

*   Single choice options
*   Shown side-by-side or stacked
*   Where there is space to show them all at once

## When not to use

*   Don’t use when there is more than 20 options
*   When there’s only two options, consider if a single [checkbox](/components/checkbox-field) would be better.
*   For settings that are immediately applied, consider using a [toggle switch](/components/toggle-switch-field) instead.
*   When there’s limited space, consider using a select dropdown instead.
*   Sometimes, a dropdown menu might be better. If it’s an infrequently used setting, has a good default, has 4 or more options, consider using a select dropdown menu.

Some websites have a “radio button group” concept where radio options are styled like buttons and you can only select one in the group. That’s a different thing to this.
