## Visuals
Coming soon.

## When to use

* To organize information that needs to be prominent and inviting.
* When you have enough content to fill the space effectively. If you only have a little bit of information, use a
guidance block or a [Card](/components/card) component.
* When it's the primary feature of the page.
* For "at a glance" information that focuses the user's attention on one thing.

## When not to use

*   When there's long form content underneath, such as high density data in a [Table](/components/table), consider using
 a less prominent component, such as a guidance block or a [Card](/components/card) component.
