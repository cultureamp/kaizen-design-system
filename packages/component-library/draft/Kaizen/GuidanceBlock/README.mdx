## Options

To ensure the Guidance Block is distinct from other page content, you might use a different visual treatment for the card container.

## To keep in mind

The Guidance Block is a modular design element with a consistent structure and a clear call to action. It is commonly used to:

* Prompt a user action (e.g. Select a focus area, create an action, redact comments, start onboarding)
* Provide a summary view of longer form content contained on another page. This is similar to a content application of [tile](/components/hero-card) but with more prominence/hierarchy (e.g Manager learning)
* Cross promote relevant content or functionality in a different part of the platform.

### Anatomy

* **Card container:** The Guidance Block content appears inside a card.
* **Spot illustration:** Provide an illustration that assist the user in the task the Guidance Block describes.
* **Title:** Use the title to introduce the action we want people to take.
* **Description:** Use the description to give detail about what the user can expect about taking action.
* **Action button:** Use a link styled as a primary action button (if there are no others on the page) or a default action button to navigate to the page with the action that the Guidance Block describes.
* **Optional dismiss button:** If it's possible a user will never want to take this action, consider providing a secondary dismiss button to remove the Guidance Block.

### Content

To supporting time-poor users scanning for actions and skim reading content, ensure the action is clear in the button text, title, and description. This includes making the subject clear as well as making it clear to the user that the Guidance Block doesn't perform an action itself, but navigates to where the action takes place. The action indicated in the button should be clearly linked to the title or description of the Guidance Block.

### Behavior

* The Guidance Block may appear conditionally, depending on the state of the action we want the user to take. For example, if they've been through onboarding before, we might remove the Guidance Block from the page.
* If the use case action is optional or not relevant to all users, the Guidance Block may also be made dismissible.
