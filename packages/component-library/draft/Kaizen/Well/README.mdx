## Options

*   Mood:
    *   Default
    *   Positive
    *   Informative
    *   Cautionary
    *   Negative
*   Border style:
    *   Solid
    *   Dashed
    *   None

## To keep in mind

* We need boundaries to define or contextualize secondary content. Wells can provide a way to do this visually.
* An Empty State Well defines an area that doesn’t currently have content, but could.
* A Drag & Drop Well provides a visible target to drop content into.
* An Internal Content Well helps to define, divide or shape content within a card.
* An External Content Well wraps one or more cards or pieces of content into a group.

## When to use and when not to use

<DosAndDonts>
<Do>

* Use a well for secondary content.

</Do>
<Dont>

* For primary content, use a [Card](/components/card) instead.
* Don’t use a well inside well (even if there is a card separating them).
* Don’t use as a [Notification](/components/inline-notification).
* Don’t use as a [Tooltip](/components/tooltip).

</Dont>
</DosAndDonts>
