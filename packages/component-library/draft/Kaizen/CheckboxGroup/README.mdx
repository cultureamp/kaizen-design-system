## To keep in mind

*   Show options in a sensible order, such as alphabetical, numeric.
*   Avoid long lists. Chunk long lists and group related options together.
*   The setting only applies when the user takes an action, such as clicking a save button. The rare exception is for filtering checkboxes, which apply instantly.
*   Use specific, clear, concrete labels.
*   Prefer vertical (stacked) checkbox fields to easily scan and compare options.
*   Offer a default option.
*   Avoid nesting.

## When to use

*   Single choice options
*   Shown side-by-side or stacked
*   Where there is space to show them all at once

## When not to use

*   Donâ€™t use when there is more than 20 options.
*   When choices are mutually exclusive, use a [radio](/components/radio) instead.
*   For settings that are immediately applied, consider using a [toggle switch](/components/toggle-switch-field) instead.
