# Icon POC notes

## Design

### Do we want sizes to be relative to text it sits next to or static?

#### Notes
- MUI default is 24px
- Inheriting size must either be our baked in default or done manually by the consumer

#### Options
##### 1. Scale with text - no `size` prop
  - Pro: Simpler implementation
  - Con: Optical size cannot be baked in
  - Allowance: CSS vars are available for customisation by consumer

##### 2. `size` prop - static sizes
  - Pro: Can control optical size; more visually pleasing
  - Pro: Consistent scaling
  - Con: More thought required for implementation
  - Allowance: CSS vars are available for customisation by consumer

### Font weight (declare font-weight as opposed to wght in font-variation-settings)

#### Options
##### 1. Inherit font weight
  - Pro: Weight will scale to match parent
  - Con: May not be what we want
##### 2. Baked in font weight
  - Pro: We can create cohesion for controlled sizes
  - Con: Consumer will need to manually set uncontrolled scaling

### Expectations for RTL? Should we try to bake it in, or rely on the consumer?

#### Options
##### 1. Bake it in
Have a list of names which we know to apply a mirror
##### 2. Add a prop
Something like `shouldMirrorInRTL`
##### 3. Do nothing
Leave it to the consumer to handle the mirror

### Other
Any missed test cases?

## Technical

### Scope

#### Tested
- Access to all available icons from [Material symbols](https://fonts.google.com/icons?icon.size=24&icon.color=%23e8eaed&icon.style=Outlined)
  - Implemented currently as any string
- Sizes (all allow customisation through `className`)
  - Basic
    - No default implementation
  - `size` prop
    - Small/Medium/Large implemented with optical scaling
- Font weight (all allow customisation through `className`)
  - Baked in at 400
    - Consistent default value
  - Inherit as default
    - Scales according to parent
- Outline and Filled variants
  - Only Outlined style implemented
  - Prop for supporting `Filled` version
- Colour is customisable
  - Inherits from parent
- Presentation vs Meaningful icons (accessibility)
  - Can be achieved with `aria-hidden` and `aria-label`

#### Not tested in POC
- Improved discovery for icon names (currently is just any string)
- Supporting multiple styles (Outlined, Rounded, Sharp)

### Implementation

#### Set up

CDN must be set up:
- in preview-head.html for Storybook
- in `<head>` of apps

This cannot be done in plain HTML, so we either need to:
1. Get the consumers to insert manually
2. Add an injection into `KaizenProvider`
3. Use [react-helmet](https://github.com/nfl/react-helmet)
4. ??

#### Limitations

- Global class `"material-symbols-outlined"` must be used for the icons to come through
- May be a flash of icons as text prior to font-family being loaded
- CSS
  - `wght` in `font-variation-settings` cannot be set if we want to allow consumers to scale the font weight
  - See API Comparison for examples of consumer code
