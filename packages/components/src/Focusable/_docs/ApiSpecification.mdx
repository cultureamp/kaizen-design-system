## Overview

Focusable is a utility wrapper to allow users to add focus to a non-focusable element.

The main use case is for non semantic components like `Tag` that need a [Tooltip](/docs/components-tooltip-usage-guidelines--docs).

<Canvas className="mb-24" of={exampleStories.Playground} />

Be aware that this does not negate the need to meet A11Y standards and best practices. Use this
utility wrapper with caution.
