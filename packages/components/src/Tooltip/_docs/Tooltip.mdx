## Overview

Adds a popover that will show on hover or focus of the child element, with simple text content.

## Accessibility

This component wasn't built with accessibility in mind, as a result it's quite easy to implement a tooltip in a non-accessible way. A rethink and rewrite is likely for the future.

There's two major accessibility concerns here:
- Keyboard only users
- Screen reader (or similar assistive tech) users

Failure to meet either of these requirements will result in a critical issue where some people are completely unable to access the information.

### Keyboard accessibility

For keyboard accessibility, you need to make sure the child you are passing is a focusable element. It's best to keep the contents of this component simple. E.g. just a button:

```jsx
<Tooltip text="Opens in a new tab">
  <Button href="/path" label="Go somewhere" />
</Tooltip>
```

### Screen reader accessibility

Though it won't guarantee the best screen reader accessibility, a good start is to make sure your _direct_ children element is semantic (not a div or span).

When your direct child element is semantic, this component will add an `aria-describedby` to that element. E.g. for the link example above, the resulting mark up will be:

```html
<a href="path" aria-describedby="tooltip">Go somewhere</a>
<!-- (in a portal) -->
<div id="tooltip-id">Opens in a new tab</div>
```

Resulting in a screen reader announcement like:
`Go somewhere, link, Opens in a new tab`

Again, try to keep the contents of your children as simple as possible, ideally only a single natively focusable element like the example above.

When your direct child is not semantic, you will get a console warning like this:
`<Tooltip /> is not directly wrapping a semantic element, screen reader users will not be able to access the tooltip info.`


### Tooltips, Kaizen components and common pitfalls

While technically any Kaizen component can be wrapped by a `Tooltip`, as called out previously, only those with accessible roles will be readable to assistive technologies.

We've created some guidance below with the most common cases for `Tooltip` and how to ensure the additional context is read to the user.

#### Button and IconButton

<Canvas of={TooltipStories.ButtonsWithTooltip} />

While Kaizen buttons are compatible with `Tooltip`, caution is advised when using the custom `component` render prop.

```JSX
  <Tooltip text="Contact customer support.">
    <Button
      {...buttonProps}
      component={() => (
        // The most immediate child is a `div`, which has no `role`.
        <div>
          <button type="button">
            Help
          </button>
        </div>
      )}
    />
  </Tooltip>
```

In the example above, the `div` in now the direct descendant of `Tooltip`, therefore will no longer be accessible to assistive technologies.


#### ButtonGroup

The `Tooltip` component must wrap the children of `ButtonGroup` to be accessible to screen readers.

#### Table headers and tooltips

While the composable `Tooltip` is not exposed in the Kaizen `Table`, it is important to call out that the `tooltipInfo` prop in `TableHeaderRowCell` must also have an `onClick` or `href` to be announced to assistive technologies.

<Canvas of={TooltipStories.TableHeadersWithTooltips} />


#### Tags

If the original [Tag]("/?path=/docs/components-tag--docs") is wrapped by a `Tooltip` component, its children will not accessible to screen readers as it's direct descendant is a `div`.

```JSX
<Tooltip text="Tooltip label">
  {/*
    The Tag has no semantic role and is not interactive, so neither keyboard
    nor assistive technologies will be able to read the tooltip Tooltip label".
  */}
  <Tag>ad veniam sapiente</Tag>
</Tooltip>
```

While tooltips should be avoided for non-interactive and non-semantic elements, like the default Tag, the [future Tag]("/?path=/docs/components-tag-future--docs") offers a composable solution for those needing to add more context to Tags with interactive states.
