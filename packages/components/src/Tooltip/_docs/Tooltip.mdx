## Overview

Adds a popover that will show on hover or focus of the child element, with simple text content.

## Accessibility

This component wasn't built with accessibility in mind, as a result it's quite easy to implement a tooltip in a non-accessible way. A rethink and rewrite is likely for the future.

There's two major accessibility concerns here:
- Keyboard only users
- Screen reader (or similar assistive tech) users

Failure to meet either of these requirements will result in a critical issue where some people are completely unable to access the information.

### Keyboard accessibility

For keyboard accessibility, you need to make sure the child you are passing is a focusable element. It's best to keep the contents of this component simple. E.g. just a button:

```jsx
<Tooltip text="Opens in a new tab">
  <Button href="/path" label="Go somewhere" />
</Tooltip>
```

### Screen reader accessibility

Though it won't guarantee the best screen reader accessibility, a good start is to make sure your _direct_ children element is semantic (not a div or span).

When your direct child element is semantic, this component will add an `aria-describedby` to that element. E.g. for the link example above, the resulting mark up will be:

```html
<a href="path" aria-describedby="tooltip">Go somewhere</a>
<!-- (in a portal) -->
<div id="tooltip-id">Opens in a new tab</div>
```

Resulting in a screen reader announcement like:
`Go somewhere, link, Opens in a new tab`

Again, try to keep the contents of your children as simple as possible, ideally only a single natively focusable element like the example above.

When your direct child is not semantic, you will get a console warning like this:
`<Tooltip /> is not directly wrapping a semantic element, screen reader users will not be able to access the tooltip info.`
