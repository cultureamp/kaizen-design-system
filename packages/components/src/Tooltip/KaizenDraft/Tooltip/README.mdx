needToKnow:
- Tooltips are used to provide additional information when space is tight.
- Tooltips must be concise with one or more lines of text.
- Tooltips must be accessible via hover and focus only.
- Trigger tooltips from Interactive elements (Buttons, Links, Icon buttons) or Non-interactive elements (Icons, Abbreviations, Truncated text)—be mindful of keyboard accessibility
- Use sparingly. Tooltips innately hide information. Consider exposing it immediately without a tooltip or removing it completely.
- Never include any kind of error messages in a tooltip

## To keep in mind

* Use sparingly. Tooltips innately hide information. Consider exposing the information immediately without a tooltip or removing it completely.
* Tooltips have slightly different guidelines to Popovers and Modals. For more information, see [Tooltip, Popover and Modal guidelines.](https://cultureamp.design/guidelines/tooltip-popover-modal/)
* If the information is crucial for a user to proceed, consider using a [modal](https://cultureamp.design/components/modal) or [inline notification](https://cultureamp.design/guidelines/notifications) instead.

### Anatomy

* The anatomy of a tooltip is made up of a container, description and arrow.
    * They do not include a title or heading. If you need to include a title, use a [Popover](https://cultureamp.design/components/popover/)
* A tooltip is connected to a trigger element, such as a button or icon, that shows the tooltip when the interactive trigger element is hovered or focused. (More details below.)

### Moods

For context, see [Moods](https://cultureamp.design/guidelines/moods).

* When combined with an icon, use the matching icon and mood (Positive, Informative, Cautionary and Highlight). For example, when using a blue information icon, show an informative tooltip.
* When applied without a mood-based trigger, use the Default tooltip (white).

### Visual details

* Text within tooltips must be left aligned (with RTL support).
* Tooltip arrows are positioned to any side of the container, depending on available space within the browser chrome/viewport.
    * By default, the arrow is anchored to the bottom of the container.
    * If space is limited, the position of the arrow will adapt to its environment.
    * Arrows can be positioned on all four sides of the container.
* Use strong signifiers for trigger elements to ensure the tooltip is discoverable.
* The proximity of tooltips is always paired to the element with which they are associated. 
    * Apply 6px/0.25 Grid Unit spacing between trigger and the point of the arrow.

### Trigger

- Needs to be discoverable:
  - E.g. something like an icon to suggest there’s a tooltip.
  - Avoid triggering tooltips from text that excludes a visual indicator (e.g. underline)
- Needs to not be noisy (e.g. we don’t litter UI with icons all the time)
- Only trigger tooltips from:
  - Interactive elements:  
    - Buttons
    - Links
    - Icon buttons
  - Non-interactive elements (be mindful of keyboard accessibility):
    - Icons
    - Abbreviations (e.g. dashed underlined text for HRIS that shows a tooltip that says Human Resource Information System)
    - Truncated text
- For interactive elements that trigger tooltips, only have optional information in the tooltip because it could be missed when the user clicks.

### Behavior

* By default, the tooltip’s arrow centers to the trigger. The arrow may shift left, right, up, down depending on available space between trigger and viewport/browser chrome.
* The tooltip is also aware of its proximity to the edge of the viewport and will move to another available position of the trigger where it fits more comfortably.
    * I.e: If too close to the left, it will reposition to the right - so as to always be visible.

### Animation details

* By default, a Tooltip lifts up from the trigger point, by “slide fading” towards the top of the screen away from the trigger point.
* Related: Tooltip arrows always point down and “slide fade” upwards unless they're at a viewport edge, then the tooltip should move in the opposite (and most logical) direction.

### Usage

* Use sparingly. If you’re building something that requires a lot of tooltips, work on clarifying the design and the language in the experience.
* Only show one tooltip at a time.

### Accessibility

* Tooltips contain limited content so we can use an ‘announcer’ to announce tooltip content to people using screen readers e.g. using an ARIA live region.
* In contrast, a user might interact with a [Popover](https://cultureamp.design/components/popover/), requiring focus, so we need to move focus to the popover when it’s triggered and support keyboard navigation to dismiss a dismissible popover.

## Copy guidelines

Tooltips are a useful way to highlight additional information for a feature or element in the platform. Use them sparingly and keep these rules in mind:

### They shouldn’t be a barrier to task completion

Tooltips should never stop a user (or be a gate) from completing a task or performing an action. They disappear so they should never contain critical information that a user would absolutely need to proceed, or information without which a user may cause errors. If the information is crucial for a user to proceed, consider using a [modal](https://cultureamp.design/components/modal) or [inline notification](https://cultureamp.design/guidelines/notifications) instead.

### Don’t use tooltips to convey errors

Never include any kind of error messages in a tooltip. As tooltips are hidden, a user may not be aware of an error if it exists in the tooltip text. Consider using a form input’s validation message, inline notification or toast notification to convey an error message.

### Keep it brief

Good tooltips contain concise and helpful information. Keep it short (we recommend no more than 5 words max). If you need more space, consider using a [Popover](https://cultureamp.design/components/popover/). Don’t use it to duplicate information that already exists on the page. Instead, closely consider its placement and whether the disclosed copy will inform the action the user is about to perform.

### Avoid links and buttons

As tooltips only surface from a hover, never include links or buttons in the copy. If your tooltip requires either of these, consider putting your content in a [Popover](https://cultureamp.design/components/popover).

### Write in sentence case with minimal punctuation

All tooltips copy should be in sentence case i.e. the first letter of the first word is capitalized and everything else is in lower case unless it’s a [proper noun or feature name](https://cultureamp.design/language/grammar/#capitalization). Always err on the side of minimal punctuation, so leave out full stops and commas where possible.

## When to use and when not to use

<WhenToUseAndWhenNotToUse>
<WhenToUse>

* Use when the description content would be too much information to include inline or create too much clutter. For example, when expert users have seen it many times.
* Use for icon-only buttons, text links (e.g. Opens in a new tab) or for a button with an associated keyboard shortcut.

</WhenToUse>
<WhenNotToUse>

* Don’t use tooltips to restate visible UI text.
* If you need lots of icons to trigger lots of tooltips, consider an onboarding pattern, such as Coach Marks (TBD).
* If you need to show a message on page load, consider [Popovers](https://cultureamp.design/components/popover/) or an onboarding pattern, such as Coach Marks (TBD).
* To communicate critical information, including errors in forms or other interaction feedback. Consider using [Modals](https://cultureamp.design/components/modal) or [Notifications](https://cultureamp.design/guidelines/notifications)
* When you need to include links or buttons. Consider using a [Popover](https://cultureamp.design/components/popover).
