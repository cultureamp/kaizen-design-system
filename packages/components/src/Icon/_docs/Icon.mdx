## Installation

Each icon is imported separately, for example if you'd like the `AddIcon` you will use the following import.

```js
import { AddIcon } from "@kaizen/components"
```

See: Reference for all icons available to import.

## Overview

All Icon components can be meaningful or presentational icons.

<Canvas of={IconStories.Playground} />
<Controls of={IconStories.Playground} />

## Applying Colour

Icon's inherit the text colour of the parent element, so updating its colour is as simple as adding a wrapper with a new text colour.

<Canvas of={IconStories.ApplyColour} sourceState="shown" />

Tip: click on the icon you want for a quick copy!
