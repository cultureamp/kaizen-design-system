## Playground

This is a page template component containing the header, footer and main landmarks that compose a Workflow page. Its purpose is to guide an customer through a multi-step form to create a Workflow.

The Worflow is intended as a page wrapper and sets minimum height of `100vh` with a sticky `Header` component. The `Children` will be wrapped in a unstyled main landmark to provide flexibility for inner content layouts.

This component has responsiveness baked in to support 400% zoom and smaller screen sizes. This will also un-stick the `Header` to provide more realestate for the user.

<Controls of={Workflow.Playground} exclude={["children"]} />

## Final step

While the footer actions can take any JSX elements we recommend using the @kaizen/button component to handle page routing and submit requests for visual continuity

The progress stepper will update its completed and in progress indicators by comparing the stepName to the array of steps.

## Completed Workflow

Instances where users are returning to a completed worklow you can pass the `isComplete` prop to set the indicators to their "complete" status. This will be reflected in their aria title

<Canvas layout="fullscreen" of={Workflow.CompletedWorkflow} />


## Composable Workflow

While we advise against it, each component is exported from the `@kaizen/workflow` package so a custom workflow can be composed from its children if absolutely neccessary
