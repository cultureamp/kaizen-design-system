## Overview

`LinkButton` allows users to navigate to another page or resource within a web page or application.

The following example and table showcases the essential props that enable the core functionality of `LinkButton`. For the remaining suite of API options refer to [this section](#additional-api-options).

<Controls of={exampleStories.Playground} include={["className", "children", "href", "target", "download", "onPress", "routerOptions", "hasHiddenLabel",  "size", "variant", "icon", "iconPosition", "isFullWidth", "isDisabled" ]} />

## API

This is built on top of [React Aria's Link component](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-aria/Link.html) and is the counterpart to the <LinkTo pageId="actions-button-button-v3-api-specification--docs">Kaizen Button</LinkTo>, handling icons, variants and sizes in the same way. It provides a semantic wrapper for navigational buttons and allows for native `href` navigation and client side routing with [additional configuration](#client-side-routing) .

### Navigation and routing

{/* // TODO: basic docs on href usage */}


### Client side routing

While the `LinkButton` supports native `href` navigation out of the box, it is agnostic to the routing technology chosen. As such, additional set up is required to support client side routing from `React Router` or `Next.js`.

In order to achieve this, you can use the [RouterProvider](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-aria/routing.html#routerprovider) from the `react-aria-components` library, along with the additional configuration for each routing solution.

#### Next.js config example

The following example demonstrates how to use the `RouterProvider` with `Next.js`'s Pages router. This will allow the `LinkButton` to navigate using the `router.push` method.

```tsx
import type {AppProps} from "next/app"
import {type NextRouter, useRouter} from "next/router"
import { RouterProvider } from "react-aria-components"

// This provides the necessary typings for the routerOptions to uses of LinkButton across the app
declare module "react-aria-components" {
  interface RouterConfig {
    routerOptions: NonNullable<Parameters<NextRouter["push"]>[2]>;
  }
}

export default function NextPageRouterApp({ Component, pageProps }: AppProps) {
  const router = useRouter()

  return (
    <RouterProvider
      navigate={(href, opts) => router.push(href, undefined, opts)}
    >
      {/* ...application code */}
    </RouterProvider>
  )
}
```

Additional notes on Next.js config can be found in the React Aria's documentation on the [RouterProvider](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-aria/routing.html#routerprovider), including the alternative setup for the [App router](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-aria/routing.html##app-router).

#### React Router config example
The following example demonstrates how to use the `RouterProvider` with `React Router`'s. This will allow the `LinkButton` to navigate using the `useNavigate` hook.

```tsx
import { RouterProvider } from "react-aria-components"
import { BrowserRouter, NavigateOptions, useHref, useNavigate } from "react-router-dom"

declare module "react-aria-components" {
  interface RouterConfig {
    routerOptions: NavigateOptions
  }
}

function ReactRouterApp() {
  const navigate = useNavigate()

  return (
    <RouterProvider navigate={navigate} useHref={useHref}>
      {/* ...application code */}
      <Routes>
        <Route path="/" element={<HomePage />} />
        {/* ...routes */}
      </Routes>
    </RouterProvider>
  )
}
```

Additional notes can be found in the React Aria's documentation on the using the `RouterProvider` with [React Router](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-aria/routing.html#react-router).

### Variants

`LinkButton` supports the following variants: `primary`, `secondary` and `tertiary`. If the `variant` prop is not specified, the default will be `primary`.

<Canvas of={exampleStories.LinkButtonVariants} />

Reversed variants are handled via the `ReversedColors` Provider.

<DocsStory of={exampleStories.LinkButtonVariantsReversed} expanded={false} />

To enable the reversed theme, you will need to wrap the component or application in the `ReversedColors` provider, ie:

```tsx
import { RouterProvider } from "react-aria-components"
import { Button } from "@kaizen/components/v3/actions"
import { ReversedColors } from "@kaizen/components/v3/utilities"
// application code

return (
  <ReversedColors isReversed={true}>
    <LinkButton {...LinkbuttonProps} />
  </ReversedColors>
)
```

### Sizes

LinkButton supports the following sizes: `small`, `medium` and `large`. If the `size` prop is not specified, the default will be `medium`.

<Canvas of={exampleStories.LinkButtonSizes} />

### `onPress`

TODO: revamp this section: One key change to the `LinkButton`&apos;s API is the shift from `onClick` to React Aria's implementation of `onPress`. This approach has been adopted as it provides better support for consistent touch events across device types, such mobile, desktop and tablet. You can read more about the development and reason behind this pattern [here](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/blog/building-a-button-part-1.html#touch-interactions).

Functionally this does not change the way we pass actions into `LinkButton`. Consumers can safely replace `onClick` with `onPress` without any additional changes, ie:

```tsx
<LinkButton label="Submit" onClick={e => sumbit(e)}/>
```

Can safely be replaced with the following:

```tsx
<LinkButton onPress={e => submit(e)}>
  Submit
</LinkButton>
```


### Button content and children

Labels and any button content can be passed into the `LinkButton` as `children`. Content wrapped by the `LinkButton` will be spaced evenly relative to the `size` prop.

```tsx
<LinkButton variant="secondary" href="#link">
  Label
</LinkButton>
```

While in most cases, `children` will be a `ReactNode`, `LinkButton` also accepts a render function with React Aria's `LinkRenderProps`. This allows for more advanced styling and rendering options by hooking into React Aria's internal button state. You can read more about this [here](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-aria/Link.html#styling).

### Icons and positioning

The `icon` property abstracts the need to handle positioning and sizing logic for icons within the `LinkButton`. When paired with the [Icon component](/docs/illustrations-icon-icon-future-api-specification--docs), this will scale the icon to the `LinkButton`'s `size` prop.

<Canvas of={exampleStories.LinkButtonWithIconStart} />

Set the position of the icon using the `iconPosition` prop. This will ensure content is flipped in `RTL` layouts. Note that icons will need the [shouldMirrorInRTL](/docs/illustrations-icon-icon-future-api-specification--docs#mirror-in-rtl) prop set to `true` when mirroring is required.

<Canvas of={exampleStories.LinkButtonWithIconEnd} />


### Icon-only `LinkButton` and `hasHiddenLabel`

To achieve an icon-only `LinkButton` (previously: `IconButton`) use the `icon` prop and set `hasHiddenLabel` to `true`. This will visually hide the button's `children`, while still announcing the content to screen readers.

<Canvas of={exampleStories.IconLinkButton} />

This pattern ensures that the `LinkButton`'s accessible name is determined by its children, which helps to announce relevant content to the screen readers. You can learn more about this [accessible pattern here](https://cultureamp.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/PA/pages/3833331831/Accessible+button+and+link+labels).


### Full width LinkButtons

If a `LinkButton` is statically the full width of a container you can use the `isFullWidth` property.

<Canvas of={exampleStories.LinkButtonFullWidth} />

For resizing on smaller screens, consider using the `className` prop to leverage CSS media or container queries, ie: `<LinkButton className="w-full md:w-[initial]">Label</LinkButton>`.

## Additional API options

The following table is a collection of additional React Aria and native HTML props that are exposed from the [React Aria Link API](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-aria/Link.html). These are not required for the implementation of `LinkButton` but can be used to extend its functionality. Refer back to the [overview section](#overview) for the core props that enable most use cases.
