## Overview

<Canvas of={exampleStories.Playground} />

## API

<Controls of={exampleStories.Playground} className="mb-64" include={["children", "className",  "size", "variant", "onPress", "icon", "iconPosition", "isFullWidth", "isDisabled", "isPending", "isPendingLabelHidden",  "pendingLabel"]} />

### Other API options
Additional API options including those defined in the [React Aria Button API](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-aria/Button.html#props).

<Controls of={exampleStories.Playground} className="mb-64" exclude={["children", "className",  "size", "variant", "onPress", "icon", "iconPosition", "isFullWidth", "isDisabled", "isPending", "isPendingLabelHidden",  "pendingLabel"]} />

### React Aria

This component is built using the react-aria-components library and extends the [Button](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-aria/Button.html) component.

As this shares the same core [anatomy](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-aria/Button.html#anatomy), [props types](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-aria/Button.html#anatomy) and [event handlers](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-aria/Button.html#events), the guidance below is tailored to our implementation and should cover most known use cases of the Button.

For more scenarios that may not be present below, we recommend checkout out React Aria&apos;s documentation on the [Button's available hooks](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-aria/Button.html#hooks) or [advanced customization](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-aria/Button.html#advanced-customization) options.


### onPress vs onClick

One key change to the `Button`&apos;s API is the shift from `onClick` to `onPress`. This will not require a change to the implementation of `onClick` logic, ie:
```
<Button label="Submit" onClick={(e) => sumbit(e)}/>
// can safely be migrated to:
<Button onPress={(e) => submit(e)}>
  Submit
</Button>
```

React Aria&apos;s implementation of `onPress` provides better support for consistent touch events across device types, such mobile, desktop and tablet. You can read more about the development and reason behind this pattern [here](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/blog/building-a-button-part-1.html#touch-interactions).


### Interactive states and styling pseudo-classes

Psuedo classes, such as `hover`, `focus` or `focus-visible`, are now targeted and styled with HTML data attributes that reflect the internal state of the React Aria Button (ie: `isHovered`, `isFocusVisible`).

When styling in CSS, it is recommended to use [data attributes](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-aria/Button.html#styling), such as `:[data-hovered]` or `:[data-focus-visible]`, instead of using pseudo selectors like `:hover` or `:focus-visible`.

```css
.button {
  background-color: $color-white;
  &:hover {
    background-color: $color-gray-200;
  }
}
// becomes
.button {
  background-color: $color-white;
  &:[data-hovered] {
    background-color: $color-gray-200;
  }
}
```

#### Dynamic styles with ButtonRenderProps

As `Button` extends React Aria&apos;s functionality, `className` can now accept either a `string` or function that receives the `Button`&apos;s state for styling, such as `isPressed` or `isHovered`. This useful for add dynamic styling tweaks with Tailwind or other CSS-in-JS libraries.


<Canvas of={specStories.RACRenderPropsWithClassName} sourceState="shown" />

This can also be styled in directly with Tailwind targeting the data attributes, ie:

```tsx
  <Button className="[&[data-focused='true']]:bg-blue-300">Label</Button>
```

React Aria also offers a [Tailwind plugin](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-aria/styling.html#plugin) that exposes the styling states of React Aria Components into Tailwind. This can make classes and allows you to leverage intellisense when working with React Aria components, ie:

```tsx
  <Button className="pressed:bg-blue-300">Label</Button>
```


For more on styling with React Aria and other ways to extend the `Button`&apos;s styles, we recommend checking out the [docs here](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-aria/Button.html#styling).


### Icons, labels and content as children

In `v3`, labels, icons and their positions are controlled by the consumer as `children`. The immediate children of `Button` are spaced using `flex-gap` to ensure `RTL` can be supported out of the box for most cases.

<Canvas of={exampleStories.ButtonWithIcon} />


While the expected default is that `children` will be a `ReactNode`, it also accepts a render function that takes `ButtonRenderProps`. Similar to the className, this exposes the internal state (`isPressed`, `isHovered`, etc) of the button and can be used for conditional rendering.

```tsx
<Button>
  {({isPressed}) => (
    <>
      {isPressed && <PressHighlight />}
      Press me
    </>
  )}
</Button>
```


### Icon only buttons

To achieve the `IconButton` pattern in `v3`, we recommend passing an icon in as a the sole child. The label should be added to the icon&apos;s `aria-label` prop in the SVG Icon.

<Canvas of={exampleStories.IconButton} className="mb-32" />

We recommend against setting the `aria-label` on the `Button` itself, and letting the accessible label be [determined by the children](https://cultureamp.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/PA/pages/3833331831/Accessible+button+and+link+labels). You can achieve this by using visually hidden elements as children, which will create an accessible label based off the contents of the button.


### Reversed Colors

The `Button` uses the `useReversedColors` hook and `ReversedColors` provider to control the dark and light theme.

<Canvas className="bg-purple-600 mb-24" of={exampleStories.ReversedButton} />

To enable the reversed theme, you will need to the component or application in the ReversedColors provider, ie:

```tsx
import { Button } from "@kaizen/components/v3/actions"
import { ReversedColors } from "~components/__utilities__/v3"
// application code

return (
  <ReversedColors isReversed={true}>
    <Button {...buttonProps} />
  </ReversedColors>
)
```


### Buttons and links

`v3` of the `Button` component does not support the `href` prop. While a `Link` component will be coming to Kaizen, we recommend using the `v2` of button if a `anchor` or routing link is needed.

We do not advise passing in an `anchor` tag as a child of the `Button` as this can lead to accessibility issues.
