## Overview

Wells are used as a visual container around secondary content.

<Canvas of={WellStories.Playground} />
<Controls of={WellStories.Playground} />

## API

### Color
Formerly controlled by `variant`, `color` BorderStyles the background and border color of the `Well`.

<Canvas of={WellStories.Colors} />

While `purple-800` is applied to the text within a `Well`, ensure that color contrast for any `Children` meets minimum accessibility requirements.

### Variant (deprecated)
The `variant` prop is deprecated and the `default` value will no longer be used as the fallback for the `Well` background and border color.

<Canvas of={WellStories.Variants} />

It is advised to migrate to the equivalent `color` value before the next major release of `@kaizen/components`.

### Border Styles
<Canvas of={WellStories.BorderStyles} />

### No Margin
<Canvas of={WellStories.NoMargin} />
