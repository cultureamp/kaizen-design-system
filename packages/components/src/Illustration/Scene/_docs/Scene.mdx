### Animated scenes

Some Scene illustrations have animated versions. Looped animation should be used sparingly as it can be distracting for users, especially those with motion sensitivity. Consider also the WCAG spec for [non-essential animations](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/animation-from-interactions.html).

Note that all Scene illustration with `autoplay` and `loop` set to `true` will render the animation toggle.

This can be overridden by setting `hasVisibleAnimationToggle` to `false`, which will render the toggle only on hover or focus. Note that this can have accessibility implications, so use with caution.
