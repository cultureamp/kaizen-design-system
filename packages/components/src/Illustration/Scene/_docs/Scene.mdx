### Animated scenes

Some Scene illustrations have animated versions. Looped animation should be used sparingly as it can be distracting for users, especially those with motion sensitivity. Consider also the WCAG spec for [non-essential animations](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/animation-from-interactions.html).
