## Overview

`Card`s are used to contain related elements which can include anything from illustrations to headlines, supporting text, buttons, and lists. They have flexible layouts and dimensions based on their contents. `Card`s are elevated one or two steps above the surface.

### isAiLoading and AI Moments

AI Moments have two visual state controlled but the `isAiLoading` prop. This will animate the Cards's border and background while `true` and remain static while `false`.

<Canvas of={CardStories.AIMoment} />

Always use this in combination with other Kaizen loading components such as `LoadingHeading`, `LoadingParagraph`, and `LoadingGraphic` to communicate loading visually.

The `Card` inherits the background color from the `color` property. Although this flexibility exists typically use should be limited to white to ensure sufficient color contrast.
