## Overview

Tags helps users quickly recognize important information about items that organize and categorize them.

Note: Tag does not yet have feature parity with the legacy Tag component. The goal with this
component was to have a more flexible version of legacy Tag, and we will slowly add more functionality
to this component until we reach feature parity.

## API

<Canvas of={TagStories.Playground} />
<Controls of={TagStories.Playground} />

### `children`

Takes a `ReactNode`. This should be the text that is displayed inside the Tag.

<Canvas of={TagStories.Children} />

### `color`

Determines the color of the background, text, and icon. This can be used to convey status and give meaning to the `Tag`. Find more guidance on color usage [here](https://cultureamp.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/DesignSystem/pages/3064857902/Color).

<Canvas of={TagStories.Color} />

### `icon`

An optional icon can be passed via this prop. The icon will be rendered on the left of `children`
in LTR, and on the right of `children` in RTL. For a list of icons, see [Icons](?path=/story/components-icons--sticker-sheet-default)

<Canvas of={TagStories.IconStory} />

### `classNameOverride`

Allows classnames to be attached to the outermost element of Tag.

<Canvas of={TagStories.ClassNameOverride} />

#### variant

`variant` has been dropped as a catch all way to supply context and mean to `Tag`. Instead, `color` and `icon` should be used to capture sentiment, validation and status.

### Migrating to next Tag

See our [full guide](?path=/docs/components-tag-next-tag-migration-guide--docs) here to migrate to the next release of `Tag`.
