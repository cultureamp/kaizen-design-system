# Internationalization in Kaizen

The goal of Internationalization in Kaizen is to handle the translation of hard-coded strings in Kaizen components.

If you need guidance on translating your app check, the `@cultureamp/i18n-react-intl` [package docs](https://github.com/cultureamp/unified-home/blob/master/packages/i18n-react-intl/README.md).

## What Kaizen internationalization covers

While most Kaizen components receive display text and accessibility information through props, some have text built in. For some of these cases, Kaizen provides translation support. 
Note: Internationalization in Kaizen _does not_ handle translations for the following:

- Strings outside of Kaizen components

- Strings passed into Kaizen components by you (through props or children)

Disclaimer: Internationalization is a new feature in Kaizen, and not all Kaizen components are translated yet.
Please check with us on a case-by-case basis regarding which components are translated. Also keep in mind that translations take time to be fully processed, meaning that components with translation support may have messages for certain locales but not others at any given time. 
For a full list of our supported languages and their tiers, see [here](https://github.com/cultureamp/translation-bot/blob/master/config/kaizen-design-system.yaml). 

## Usage

Setting up internationalization for Kaizen components involves:

- Adding unified-homeâ€™s `react-intl` [webpack-plugin](https://github.com/cultureamp/unified-home/tree/master/packages/i18n-react-intl#integrating-with-webpack) to your webpack config

- Wrapping your app in one of the IntlProviders from [@cultureamp/i18n-react-intl](https://github.com/cultureamp/unified-home/tree/master/packages/i18n-react-intl#wrap-your-app-in-provider)

Note: This will work with StaticIntlProvider or DynamicIntlProvider.
```ts
import { DynamicIntlProvider } from "@cultureamp/i18n-react-intl"

<DynamicIntlProvider>
   <YourApp/>
</DynamicIntlProvider>
```

With this setup, any Kaizen components with translation support will be translated for you.
