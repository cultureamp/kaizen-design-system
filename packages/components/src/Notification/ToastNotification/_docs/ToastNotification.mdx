## Overview

Toast notifications are used to notifying a user of an outcome for an action they have taken.
They appended to the root of the document body and will render in the top corner of the window.

**Note:** Toast notifications must be used within <LinkTo pageId="components-kaizen-provider-installation">KaizenProvider</LinkTo>.

## API

Use the following helper methods available through the `useToastNotification` hook to create and manage Toast notifications.

### addToastNotification

Adds and appends a new notification to the list.

<Canvas of={ToastNotificationStories.CreateNotification} />

### updateToastNotification

Updates a single notification that matches the `id` passed to the function.

<Canvas of={ToastNotificationStories.UpdateNotification} />

### removeToastNotification

Removes a single notification that matches the `id` passed to the function.

<Canvas of={ToastNotificationStories.RemoveNotification} />

### clearToastNotifications

Clears all notifications currently held in state.

Note that since each story has an individual context, this example will only clear the ones it adds.

## Accessibility and removal of notifications

Any notification that is temporarily rendered on screen should provide a user ample time to read its contents and
provide a way to stop its removal ([WCAG guidline here](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/time-limits.html)).

By default, all Toast notifications will remain on screen until dismissed.
This ensures the accessibility is met and does not require additional intervention.

If you required to be automatically removed, you must provide a means of stopping and re-enabling its
removal and ensures that a user can reasonably access this before it is removed.
