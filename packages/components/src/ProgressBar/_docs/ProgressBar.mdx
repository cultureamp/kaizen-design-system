## Overview

Progress bars show continuous progress through a process, such as a percentage value. They show how much progress is complete and how much remains.

## API

### isAnimating

Adds an animated state that indicates system processes, such as downloading, uploading, or processing.

<Canvas of={ProgressBarStories.IsAnimating} />

### Moods

### Value and max

While `value` and `max` can be used to represent progress as either a percentage or fraction, screen readers will always announce this as a calculated percentage.

### Accessible context

Due to the optional `label` prop, the progress bar does not have an accessible name. You can provide context for assistive technologies with aria attributes such as `aria-label` or `aria-labelledby`.
