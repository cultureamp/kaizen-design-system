    ### Disclaimer

    The `v3` of `Button` is a partial rebuild to support [Menu v3](/docs/actions-menu-v3-api-specification--docs). As the changes to the API between `v1/v2` to `v3` is significant, our recommendation is to hold on adopting this outside of `Menu` `v3` as it will have a limited set of options.

  ## Overview

  This is the rebuild of the Button component - the main changes present in `v3` will relate to an updated API. More guidance will be provided following the completion of the Button RFC.
