## Overview

Icons are simplified visual symbols that represent ideas, objects, or actions. They improve comprehension, guide interactivity, and draw attention to important information.

<Canvas of={IconStories.Playground} />
<Controls of={IconStories.Playground} include={["name", "isFilled"]} />

### When to use

- To represent an idea, object, or action in a clear and concise manner.
- To enhance the user interface by providing visual cues and improving navigation.
- To draw attention to important information or actions.
- To improve comprehension and reduce the need for textual explanations.
- To create a more engaging and visually appealing design.

### When not to use

- When the meaning of the icon is not immediately clear or could be misinterpreted.
- When text is necessary to convey specific or detailed information.
- When using too many icons could clutter the interface and overwhelm the user.
- When accessibility is a concern and the icon does not have appropriate alternative text or support.
- When the icon does not align with the overall design language or style of the application.

### Specs

Use [default icons](#default-icon-set) (common icons already in use within existing Kaizen components) they will remain available in Figma directly.

When you need a new icon, use Google's [Material Symbols](https://fonts.google.com/icons) set via the [Figma plugin](https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/1088610476491668236/material-symbols) to add the relevant icons in:
- Outlined
- Weight: 400
- Grade: Normal (0)
- Fill: On or Off

They will not need to be added to the Kaizen icon subset in order to be used in designs or to be built.

#### Optical size

If using icons at a larger size than the default 20px, scale the Optical Size to match the size of the icon.

#### Alignment

Vertically center the icon by shifting down the baseline of symbols to approximately 11.5% of the type size.

Whilst you have access to all Material Symbols, the following icons match the default set we have in Figma.
