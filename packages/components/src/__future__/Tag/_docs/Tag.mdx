## Overview

Tags helps users quickly recognize important information about items that organize and categorize them.

Note: Tag does not yet have feature parity with the legacy Tag component. The goal with this
component was to have a more flexible version of legacy Tag, and we will slowly add more functionality
to this component until we reach feature parity.
