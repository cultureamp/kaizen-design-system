## Overview

Similar to the Tag component, but with a remove icon, that recieves a callback from props.
The consumer should manage the state regarding whether or not the icon should be rendered,
and pass a callback to remove the RemovableTag component via the `removeButtonProps` prop.

## API

<Canvas of={RemovableTagStories.Playground} />
<Controls of={RemovableTagStories.Playground} />

### `children`

Takes a `ReactNode`. This should be the text that is displayed inside the Tag.

<Canvas of={RemovableTagStories.Children} />

### `classNameOverride`

Allows classnames to be attached to the outermost element of Tag.

<Canvas of={RemovableTagStories.ClassNameOverride} />

### Controlling the remove button

RemovableTag tags have a `removeButtonProps` prop that can be used to control the behaviour of the remove button.

#### `aria-label`

An aria label that is attached to the remove button. This is necessary for assistive technology, such as screen-readers.
The string passed here will be read out by screen-readers when the remove button is focused.

#### `onClick`

A callback that gets invoked when clicking the remove button.
For example, if the removal of a tag is controlled by a function, that function can
be passed as a callback via this prop, and executed when clicking the remove button.
