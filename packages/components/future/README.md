# Entrypoint: future

This directory is here to redirect any imports from `@kaizen/components/future` to the correct distribution of compiled code to allow for treeshaking of future components.

## Contribution

All "future" components are to be added to the `src/__future__` directory.

### What is a "future" component?

These are components which are scheduled to replace an already existing component. **It is not** to house unfinished components.

eg. `Table` has been rebuilt and released as a "future" component for consumers to adopt.

```
// Current import which will be deprecated:
import { Table } from "@kaizen/components"

// Consumers adopt future components:
import { Table } from "@kaizen/components/future"
```

Eventually, all future components are moved to the root import.
