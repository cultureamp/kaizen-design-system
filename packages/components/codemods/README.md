#### Props

- `label` becomes `children`
  - eg. `<IconButton label="Hello" />` becomes `<Button>Hello</Button>`
- `onClick` becomes `onPress`
- Variants:
  - Default (undefined):
    - For `Button` becomes `variant="secondary"`
    - For `IconButton` becomes `variant="tertiary"`
  - `primary` becomes `variant="primary"`
  - `secondary` becomes `variant="tertiary"`
  - `destructive` will be removed (no longer available as a variant)
- Sizes:
  - Default (undefined) becomes `large`
  - `small` becomes `medium`
  - `regular` becomes `large`
- `reversed` becomes `isReversed`
- `classNameOverride` becomes `className`
- `data-automation-id` becomes `data-testid`
- `disabled` becomes `isDisabled`
- `newTabAndIUnderstandTheAccessibilityImplications` becomes `target="_blank"`
  - `rel="noopener noreferrer"` is also added
- `component` will not be removed by the codemod, but will throw a TypeScript error as the prop itself no longer exists
- For `IconButton` only:
  - `hasHiddenLabel` will be added

#### Component transformation

- `Button`/`IconButton` without the `href` or `component` prop will become `next/Button`
- `Button`/`IconButton` with the `href` prop will become `LinkButton`
- `Button`/`IconButton` with the `component` prop will become `LinkButton`
  - `component` prop will remain to throw an intentional type error to ensure manual intervention (see migration guide)

#### Imports

All imports of V1 Buttons will now point to either:

- `@kaizen/components/next` for `Button`
- `@kaizen/components` for `LinkButton`

### `upgradeIconV1`

Released in `1.67.0`; last updated in `1.68.1`

Migrates `*Icon` components to a new equivalent.

- `CaMonogramIcon` becomes `Brand` variant `enso`
  - `inheritSize` will be removed if set, if not set then `style` will be added to make it 20px (manually adjust to a `className` if you can)
- `SpinnerIcon` becomes `LoadingSpinner`
  - `aria-label` will be replaced with `accessibilityLabel` (with a fallback value of `"Loading"`)
  - `role` will be removed
  - `viewBox` will be removed
- All other Icons become next `Icon`
  - **Note:** See [Icon API Specification (next)](https://cultureamp.design/?path=/docs/illustrations-icon-icon-next-api-specification--docs) for setup instructions
  - Icons previously filled may become unfilled. This is intentional as filled icons should only be for active states or selection (see [Icon Usage Guidelines (next)](https://cultureamp.design/?path=/docs/illustrations-icon-icon-next-usage-guidelines--docs#do-use-the-appropriate-fill-for-the-icon-context-and-state))
  - `role="presentational"` becomes `isPresentational`
  - `role="img"` will be removed (as `aria-label` should exist)
  - `aria-label` becomes `alt`
  - `classNameOverride` becomes `className`
  - `inheritSize` will remain - however is no longer a valid prop, therefore will have a TypeScript error and will be prefixed with a comment to manually fix the usage
  - `aria-hidden` becomes `isPresentational`
  - `color` becomes an inline `style` (manually adjust to a `className` if you can)
  - `fontSize` will be removed
  - `height` and `width` become an inline `style` (manually adjust to a `className` if you can, ideally setting `--icon-size`)
  - `viewBox` will be removed
