## To keep in mind

* We need boundaries to define or contextualize secondary content. Wells can provide a way to do this visually.
* An Empty State Well defines an area that doesn’t currently have content, but could.
* A Drag & Drop Well provides a visible target to drop content into.
* An Internal Content Well helps to define, divide or shape content within a card.
* An External Content Well wraps one or more cards or pieces of content into a group.

## When to use and when not to use

<WhenToUseAndWhenNotToUse>
<WhenToUse>

* Use a well for secondary content.

</WhenToUse>
<WhenNotToUse>

* For primary content, use a [Card](/components/card) instead.
* Don’t use a well inside well (even if there is a card separating them).
* Don’t use as a [Notification](/components/inline-notification).
* Don’t use as a [Tooltip](/components/tooltip).
