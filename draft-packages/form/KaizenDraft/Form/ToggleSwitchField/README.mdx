## To keep in mind

*   Toggles are made up of two states: On (green, always on the right) & Off (grey, always on the left)
*   The label must include a verb. E.g. Show translations [Toggle]
*   Labels can be positioned to the left or right of a toggle, depending on layout constraints. 
*   The label should never be on both sides (e.g. On/Off).
*   Toggle switches can be triggered by a drag gesture.
*   In RTL documents, the toggle switch and label are both flipped

## When to use and when not to use

<WhenToUseAndWhenNotToUse>
<WhenToUse>

*   When space is tight.
*   Applies to a single setting. When it’s instantly applied (the page doesn’t require a save trigger), as opposed to a [Checkbox Field](/components/checkbox-field), which would require a save to action.

</WhenToUse>
<WhenNotToUse>

*   If there are more than 1 setting / option, such as filter settings, consider using a [Checkbox Group](/components/checkbox-group).

</WhenNotToUse>
