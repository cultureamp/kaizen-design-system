## To keep in mind

A radio lets a user choose to select a single item. When used in a [Radio Group](/components/radio-group), a radio lets a user make exactly one selection from a set, which is all visible at the same time.

There must always be more than one radio used together in a [radio group](/components/radio-group).

*   Ensure both label and input are clickable to select the radio. That is, use `label` tags that wrap the `input` element or use a `for` attribute.
*   Focus indicator
    *  See [Interaction states guidelines for focus indicators](/guidelines/interaction-states#focus-indicator).
    *  On keyboard navigation and click show focus indicator on radio button only (exclude label).
    *  Although the label is still navigable/clickable when selecting a radio, exclude showing the focus indicator on the label.


## When to use and when not to use

<WhenToUseAndWhenNotToUse>
<WhenToUse>

*   Only use radios inside a radio group.

</WhenToUse>
<WhenNotToUse>

*   When thereâ€™s limited space, consider using a select dropdown instead.
*   For settings that are immediately applied, consider using a [toggle switch](/components/toggle-switch-field) instead.
