## To keep in mind

A menu provides access to additional actions and navigation links on demand while preserving a minimal interface.

*   Anatomy:
    *   The **menu button** can be any of our standard [button](/components/button) components to open the menu.
    *   The **menu list** contains a list of links, buttons, dividers, or subheading. Visually, it is bounded by a similar dropdown container to our [autocomplete](/components/autocomplete) and [select](/components/select) components. It may also be referred to as a **menu dropdown**.
*   Content:
    *   For more than 6 menu items, chunk them into sections, separated by a content [divider](/components/divider). Optionally, you may provide a subheading for each section.
    *   Destructive actions are always at the end of the menu list.
    *   For an overflow menu, use an [icon button](/components/icon-button) with a meatballs icon. Overflow menus appear on the right of page or section layouts so the menu list dropdown alignment shifts in the other direction.
    *   Use a noun for the menu button text to describe the links and actions contained within.
*   Accessibility:
    *   A user might interact with a Popover, requiring focus, and it might contain rich content such as a link, so we need to move focus to the Popover when it’s triggered and support keyboard navigation to dismiss a dismissible Popover, allowing people using screen readers to fully perceive and operate the Popover content.
    *   In contrast, Tooltips contain limited content so we can use an ‘announcer’ to announce tooltip content to people using screen readers e.g. using an ARIA live region.

## When to use and when not to use

<WhenToUseAndWhenNotToUse>
<WhenToUse>

*   Use a menu when there are link and button options available that are not used enough to show by themselves.

</WhenToUse>
<WhenNotToUse>

*   When an option from the list becomes "selected", use a [Select](/components/select) instead.
*   If there are only 2 list items, show them immediately inline instead of using a menu.
*   If you think you need 10 options, reconsider information architecture, page structure, and task flows to avoid including that many items in a menu.
