## To keep in mind

A menu provides access to additional actions and navigation links on demand while preserving a minimal interface.

### Anatomy

* The **menu button** can be any of our standard [button](/components/button) components to open the menu, including an [Icon Button](/components/icon-button/) for an overflow menu (see below).
* The **menu list** contains a list of links, buttons, dividers, or subheadings. Visually, it is bounded by a similar dropdown container to our [autocomplete](/components/autocomplete) and [select](/components/select) components. It may also be referred to as a **menu dropdown**.


### Overflow menu

* An overflow menu is used to bundle multiple related or infrequently used actions. It helps to declutter the interface.
* Use an overflow menu if you are short on space / screen real estate.
* Consider using an overflow menu if you are presenting too many actions (E.g. more than 3) in the same row/space.
* For an overflow menu, use an [icon button](/components/icon-button) with meatballs icon (i.e. three horizontal dots).
* Overflow menus generally appear on the far right (in left-to-right languages) of a page or section layouts, to define a consistent location for users to look for.
* Because overflow buttons (meatballs) are generally found on the right edge (in left-to-right languages) of a page, the menu list will need to align to the right edge (in left-to-right languages) of the icon button, so that the menu faces inward towards the content area, and doesn't appear outside of the content area.

### Content

* A menu list should contain more than 1 action/link. If not, consider exposing these as individual actions.
* For more than 6 menu items, chunk them into sections, separated by a content [divider](/components/divider). Optionally, you may provide a subheading for each section.
* Actions must be indicated with an icon. Links do not have an icon.
* Action icons always live on the left of the action menu button.
* Destructive actions are always at the bottom of the menu list using the destructive menu link style (see example).


### Accessibility

* Ensure people using keyboards can open and close the menu by pressing the button and access links and buttons within the menu list.

### Focus indicator
* See [Interaction states guidelines for focus indicators](/guidelines/interaction-states#focus-indicator).
* On keyboard navigation show focus indicator on top selector.
* For menu select options show focus indicator on keyboard navigation and on click (not hover).


## Copy guidelines

* Use a noun for the menu button text to describe the links and actions contained within.

## When to use and when not to use

<WhenToUseAndWhenNotToUse>
<WhenToUse>

* Use a menu when there are link and button options available that are not used enough to show by themselves.

</WhenToUse>
<WhenNotToUse>

* When an option from the list becomes "selected", use a [Select](/components/select) instead.
* If there are only 2 list items, show them immediately inline instead of using a menu.
* If you think you need 10 options, reconsider information architecture, page structure, and task flows to avoid including that many items in a menu.
