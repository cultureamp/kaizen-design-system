## Options

*   Variant:
    *   Single-select.
    *   Multi-select.
*   Search:
    *   With search. See also: [Search Field](/components/search-field).
    *   Without search.

## To keep in mind

A single-select lets the user choose one option from 4 or more items. A multi-select lets the user choose multiple options from 4 or more items.

*   Label:
    *   Show a label for the select that describes what the options control.
        *   Where appropriate you might instead use a label for a group of controls that includes the select.
        *   Where appropriate you might use a good default value that is self-evident, explaining what the options control.
*   Anatomy:
    *   Select input: shows the currently selected option.
    *   Select dropdown menu: shows the available options. It is always shown above other elements, including the edges of modals.
*   5+ or 10+ options:
    *   If there's more than 10 options, provide another method of accessing the options such as an autocomplete search or using smart defaults by surfacing recommended options.
    *   If there's more than 5 options, consider showing options in alphabetical order or other predictable ordering for easy scanning.
*   Style option:
    *   We have alternative style for the input part of the single-select that is less prominent, currently called “Select (Text)” in the UI Kit
*   Search:
    *   There’s an option to turn on or off search in the input part.
*   Good defaults:
    *   Use a pre-selected good default where possible. In some cases, it cuts down on user decisions and validations if there is “always” a value selected. Sometimes that means including an “All” option as the first available option.
*   Interaction:
    *   Selected options:
        *   Single-select options appear highlighted and are always shown in the dropdown part (that is, they are not removed as they are selected).
        *   The multi-select shows selected items as tags and removes selected items from the dropdown part so that you cannot accidentally select an item twice.
    *   De-selecting:
        *   Single-select: where necessary, the user can de-select the selected item by clicking or tapping on a clear icon. Once removed, show placeholder text, such as “Select or search…”. Alternatively, you might require that a value is always selected so de-selecting is achieved by choosing a different option.
        *   Multi-select: the multi-select shows selected items as tags and removes selected items from the dropdown part so that you cannot accidentally select an item twice. The user can de-select selected items using by clicking or tapping the clear icon shown in the dismissible [Tags](/components/tag).
*   Loading state:
    *   We can lazy load items to be shown in the single-select on search
    *   Shows loading spinner
*   Disabled state:
    *   See [Interaction states guidelines for disabled elements](/guidelines/interaction-states#disabled-state).
*   Keyboard accessibility is tricky in Selects and need regular testing.

## When to use and when not to use

<WhenToUseAndWhenNotToUse>
<WhenToUse>

*   Use a single-select when the user needs to choose one option from 4 or more items.
*   Use a multi-select when the user needs to choose multiple options from 4 or more items.
*   Consider a select for infrequently used settings.
*   Consider a select when there is a good default option and show that as pre-selected.
*   Consider a select when you need to conserve space.

</WhenToUse>
<WhenNotToUse>

*   When there's only 2-3 options and enough space, use a [checkbox group](/components/checkbox-group), [radio group](/components/radio), or [toggle switch](/components/toggle-switch-field) instead.

</WhenNotToUse>
