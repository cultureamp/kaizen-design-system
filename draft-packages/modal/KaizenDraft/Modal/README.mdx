## Options

* Presets:
  * Confirmation:
    * Mood:
      * Destructive / Negative
      * Affirmative / Positive
      * Informative
  * Input/edit
  * Information

## To keep in mind

Modals contain smaller pieces of additional content while maintaining the context of the rest of the page, covered by a transparent overlay.

* Trigger:
  * To trigger a modal, use a button. Alternatively, trigger on page load but this risks people dismissing without reading.

### All modals

* All modals are **dismissible** (Close button, cancel button, Esc keystroke, Click outside).
* All modals use a **single Primary Action Button**. Never two primary action buttons. If a second action is an option, use a Secondary Action button (e.g. Cancel, in Cluny, no underline). Always align buttons to the center of the modal.
* Where appropriate, use precise language and **match the heading and primary button text** e.g. heading is “Delete photo” and primary button is “Delete”. Avoid questions like “Are you sure?”.
* **Don't depend on a scrollable modal body**. We only support a scrollable modal body as a fallback for when content is unintentionally long, such as when user-generated content is provided. This is strongly discouraged. If there's a high risk of a scrollable modal body:
    * Consider responsive behavior on small screens.
    * A modal might not be the best approach. Consider using an inline page section or a separate page instead.
    * Consider if any content inside the modal might be clipped, such as a Select dropdown section.
* Close icon sits top right, never outside of modal. Screen reader reads the action for the icon, i.e. “Close”.
* The backdrop overlay is pure black (not Wisteria) with 50% opacity.
* We don't use modals as carousels. A Progress stepper in a modal is preferable if you need to guide a user through a flow.
* Never stacks multiple modals together on screen at the same time.

### Confirmation modal

The confirmation modal confirms the end result of an action such as Negative or Positive actions.

- Small: 300px wide x Height (Header, footer, margins and 1 line of content). Primarily for mobile use.
- Medium: 600px wide x 600px H.
- Large: 800px wide x 800px H
- Header: States what the intent of Modal is. A verb and a noun (e.g. Upload an image, Notify users, Restart imports etc.)
- Footer: Primary/Destructive action label reflect the action they are performing (relative to the header).

We don't use custom spot illustrations in confirmation modals. Instead, use the standard spot illustrations.

### Input/edit modal

Input/edit modals allow people to change data or settings without leaving the page. They support the ability to edit up to 3 fields. Any more becomes crowded and a new page or Isolation modal is preferred.

An input/edit modal may also be used to present data-intensive information such as a list of employees where the information modal is inappropriate.

If data will be lost by dismissing the modal unintentionally, consider autosaving.

- Min: 300px wide x Height (Header, footer, margins and 1 line of content).
- Max: 800px x 600px (Must fit in laptop/mobile screen)
- Header: Should state what the intent of Modal is. A verb and a noun (e.g. Upload an image, Notify users, Restart imports etc.)
- Footer: Primary/Destructive action label should reflect the action they are performing (relative to the header).
- Body: Adding a stone colored background will assist the definition of Inputs and will allow product team to clearly identify the modal type.

### Information modals

Information modals assist with education. They’re user triggered. They may be relative to a deeper level of information. May be useful for first time users. Heavily optional. Visual aid is good. Primary action optional.

- Header: State what the intent of Modal is. A verb and a noun (e.g. Upload an image, Notify users, Restart imports etc.).
- Footer: Does not require a Primary/Destructive action. Avoid using unnecessary acknowledgment buttons, e.g. ‘Okay, got it!’.
- Visuals: use illustrations instead of screenshots where possible.
  - Illustrations may last longer without needing to be updated as well as potentially have a smaller file size than a screenshot.
  - If you need a new illustration, see [illustrations](/guidelines/illustrations).

## When to use and when not to use

<WhenToUseAndWhenNotToUse>
<WhenToUse>

- Use a modal when you need to **change the flow of content or interaction** and yet maintain the context of the existing page or task.
- Modals can be **disruptive and intrusive so use sparingly**. To avoid “banner blindness” and to avoid people immediately dismissing modals without reading them, show only on user interactions like a clicked button, not system driven events such as immediately on page load.
- **Don’t trigger modals automatically without user interaction** at any time other than page load. That is, don’t trigger modals on scroll or after some time viewing a page. This risks inaccessibly stealing keyboard focus, disorienting the user, and introducing mode errors.

</WhenToUse>
<WhenNotToUse>

- Avoid using modals on **small screens**.
- Avoid using modals when the additional content is a huge **change in context**. Consider linking to a separate page.
- Avoid using modals containing **image content** that is difficult to zoom on touch devices.
- Avoid using modals when you can immediately **present actions inline** without cluttering the UI. For example, you might show a dropdown instead of a modal containing radio buttons.
- Avoid using modals when you can **display content inline**. Consider using a collapsible “disclosure” element.
- Avoid using modals when people **need to see the rest of the screen**. Consider using a [Popover](/components/popover) or [Tooltip](/components/tooltip) instead.
- Instead of an informative modal, you might use an [inline notification](/components/inline-notification).
- Instead of a modal, consider [Overview: tooltips, popovers, modals](/guidelines/tooltip-popover-modal).
- Instead of a modal, consider a separate page.
- Instead of a modal, consider collapsible “disclosure” elements.
- Instead of a modal, consider inline actions.
