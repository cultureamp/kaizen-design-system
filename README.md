This repository is the source of truth for Culture Amp's design system documentation and hosts packages such as [Kaizen Component Library](./packages/component-library), which are used across Culture Amp's products. It is structured as a multi-package repository, with a number of independently versioned projects sharing common tools, workflows and vision.

This document serves to orient you within the repository â€” to get you set up and acquainted, and then send you off in the right direction. For more information on any specific package, please refer to its README.

## Getting started

### Setup
Set up access to private Culture Amp packages on your laptop. You will need to update `~/.npmrc` with a Github token linked to your account. Refer to the [instructions here](https://cultureamp.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/TV/pages/2776629375/Working+with+our+private+GitHub+package+registry).

### Local development
Ensure devbox is setup as per [https://cultureamp.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/DE/pages/3342434338/Devbox+setup](https://cultureamp.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/DE/pages/3342434338/Devbox+setup)

Install and start processes (this start an interactive UI in your terminal) `devbox services up`
The interactive terminal UI that pops up is called process-compose, see our [Confluence page](1) for tips on how to use it.

Please see the [LDE Confluence page](2) for more information

(Having trouble running Storybook? Try running `pnpm reset`, which includes `pnpm clean` and `pnpm install --force`!)

`pnpm storybook` | Develop components locally using Storybook
`STORIES=path/to/package pnpm storybook` | Develop just one package at a time using Storybook (builds faster!)
`pnpm compile` | Run all typechecks
`pnpm lint` | Run all linters
`pnpm lint:fix` | Run all linters, fixing violations
`pnpm plop` | Add a new component/subcomponent
`pnpm test` | Run all [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) tests
`pnpm test:storybook` | Run tests on all Storybook stories
`pnpm reset` | Reinstall all dependencies
