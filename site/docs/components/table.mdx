needToKnow:
- All tables have headers, rows, and columns.
- Don’t use a table when you can use a data visualization.

### Why?

A table organizes and displays tabular data. It shows all data in a set, whereas a data visualization might highlight only the interesting values. A table makes it efficient to look up values across multiple categories.

### What?

*   All tables have these elements:
    *   **Container: **wraps the table header and rows
    *   **Headers**: 
        *   Header row
        *   Header cell (can be checkbox etc.)
            *   Use labels that are as short as possible
    *   **Rows / cards**:
        *   Collapsed: Default
        *   (Optional) Expanded: Shows more detail about that row’s item
    *   **Columns**:
        *   The first column contains the most identifying information about the item, such as name.
*   **Expanded** **rows / cards**:
    *   Can be expanded or collapsed by an icon button containing a chevron icon
    *   Expanded cards can contain either: 
        *   A nested table: with aligned column headings and additional rows or 
        *   A card row:  that does not align with the column headers and contains different but related information that happens to sit inside of a table
*   **Summary rows**:
    *   Summary rows either provide summary data such as totals or additional metadata, such as when the item was created.
*   **Alignment**:
    *   Numerical data is often right aligned:
        *   Centered is useful for unitless, whole numbers, ratios, and dimensions e.g. 17, 5:1, or 1920x108-
        *   Right aligned numerical data with units or symbols makes it easier to scan and sum, especially for decimal places, or percentages, e.g. -17 or 50%
        *   Left aligned numerical data is useful for unitless numbers with symbols on the left, such as dollar sign ($) or hash/pound (#), e.g. $300 or #73
    *   Text data is left aligned
    *   Headers are aligned with their related data
    *   Final column is usually the second most important data and is right aligned, especially for total numbers with decimals e.g. comparison data or call to action.
*   Style:
    *   **Expanded row style**: 
        *   Our **current style is "Popout"**
        *   Our previous style is "Well" and we’re deprecating this
    *   **We don’t use “zebra striping”** on rows (alternating highlighting) because there is enough visual delineation (spacing and borders) to visually track a single item across the whole row.
    *   Responsive:
        *   On small screens, the table is sideways scrollable
        *   On touch devices (small or large), scroll is available on touch
*   **Wrap or truncate long text**:
    *   **Wrap**: wrap when there’s no other way to see the full value
    *   **Truncate**: truncate when the full value can be seen on interaction (e.g. hover/focus shows a tooltip or clicking expands the table) or elsewhere (e.g. on a page just for that data)
*   Arranging data:
    *   Sort: use an icon to indicate the column header is sortable, showing if it’s ascending, descending, or not selected
    *   Filter: use a [checkbox](https://drive.google.com/a/cultureamp.com/open?id=11il6Us44IIDO5gQNyV4IcPSuJZxYo3rfnkFQfdMWBGs) in the table or [select](https://drive.google.com/a/cultureamp.com/open?id=1DfHQktvjfgaY9nqNEHg1OxXbe-vpK1HuQ1Vz_P9v9E4) (default or secondary style) above the table
    *   Search: use search to find specific rows (showing search in the top–right above the table)
*   Selecting rows:
    *   For selecting multiple rows, use checkboxes in the first column to select multiple rows for bulk actions, such as deletion.
    *   For selecting one row, use a hover style for hovering and an active style for the selected row.
*   Bulk actions:
    *   Show bulk actions that apply to a data table using buttons above the table.
*   Pagination:
    *   For more than 10 rows and other data on the page, consider pagination or inline truncation & expansion.
    *   For more than 25 rows as the only table on the page, consider pagination or inline truncation & expansion.

### When to use?

*   Use tables when a summary or data visualization will be insufficient
*   Use tables when exact values are useful to know
*   Use tables when an item has 3+ interesting dimensions (i.e. columns) of data

### When not to use?

*   When you can summarize the data visually, use a [data visualization](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zUDHVB_tBI1eWY9oDWRivssuVQkALRNYVdIybgOiiCI/edit#heading=h.2ocvpvil9swi) instead.
