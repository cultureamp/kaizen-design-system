## To keep in mind

* We need boundaries to define or contextualise primary content in content areas.
*   Meaningful content—such as data, images, or paragraphs (but not headings)—sit on cards.
*   For data visualizations, use large cards.
*   For list data, use cards in a [List Row](#), such as Survey Index, separated by a dark [divider](https://drive.google.com/a/cultureamp.com/open?id=10Rt-LujHlgB82xxi5dQlH9VJP7gpdw5WCma89KCYQKQ).
*   For tabular data, use cards in a [Table Row](#), separated by a light [divider](https://drive.google.com/a/cultureamp.com/open?id=10Rt-LujHlgB82xxi5dQlH9VJP7gpdw5WCma89KCYQKQ).
*   For featured items, use a card in a [Tile](https://drive.google.com/a/cultureamp.com/open?id=1y1IpvQjK8kkmy8E8PiA3Jj6i0gKc_phXYrw8kRTM3uc).

### When not to use

*   For an Empty State use a [Well](https://drive.google.com/a/cultureamp.com/open?id=1DQyj5tltlbyRANV0bt2ZENKUWWXd5Qu9iCF1mTku3LA) 
*   For Drag & Drop input, use a [Well](https://drive.google.com/a/cultureamp.com/open?id=1DQyj5tltlbyRANV0bt2ZENKUWWXd5Qu9iCF1mTku3LA).
*   For supplementary content, use a [well](https://drive.google.com/a/cultureamp.com/open?id=1DQyj5tltlbyRANV0bt2ZENKUWWXd5Qu9iCF1mTku3LA) in content areas or show content without a card in areas such as Side navigation.
*   An internal content [Well](https://drive.google.com/a/cultureamp.com/open?id=1DQyj5tltlbyRANV0bt2ZENKUWWXd5Qu9iCF1mTku3LA) helps to define, divide or shape content within a card.
*   An external content [Well](https://drive.google.com/a/cultureamp.com/open?id=1DQyj5tltlbyRANV0bt2ZENKUWWXd5Qu9iCF1mTku3LA) wraps one or more cards or pieces of content into a group.
