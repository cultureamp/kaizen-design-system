## To keep in mind

* We need boundaries to define or contextualize primary content in content areas.
* Meaningful content—such as data, images, or paragraphs (but not headings)—sit on cards.
* For data visualizations, use large cards.
* For list data, use cards in a List Row, such as Survey Index, separated by a dark [divider](/components/divider).
* For tabular data, use cards in a Table Row, separated by a light [divider](/components/divider).
* For featured items, use a card in a [Tile](/components/tile).

## When to use and when not to use

<WhenToUseAndWhenNotToUse>
<WhenToUse>

- Use a Card to bring primary content off the canvas.

</WhenToUse>
<WhenNotToUse>

* For an Empty State use a [Well](/components/well).
* For Drag & Drop input, use a [Well](/components/well).
* For supplementary content, use a [well](/components/well) in content areas or show content without a card in areas such as Side navigation.
* An internal content [Well](/components/well) helps to define, divide or shape content within a card.
* An external content [Well](/components/well) wraps one or more cards or pieces of content into a group.
