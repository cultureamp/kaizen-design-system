navTitle: Checkbox Group
summaryParagraph: A checkbox group contains checkbox fields that let people select zero or more options from a set.
tags: ["Choice list", "Radio button", "Option button", "Choice", "Selection"]
needToKnow:
- Prefer vertical (stacked) checkboxes to easily scan and compare options.
- When choices are mutually exclusive, use a radio instead.
- For settings that are immediately applied, consider using a toggle switch instead.

## To keep in mind

*   Show options in a sensible order, such as alphabetical, numeric.
*   Avoid long lists. Chunk long lists and group related options together.
*   The setting only applies when the user takes an action, such as clicking a save button. The rare exception is for filtering checkboxes, which apply instantly.
*   Use specific, clear, concrete labels.
*   Prefer vertical (stacked) checkbox fields to easily scan and compare options.
*   Offer a default option.
*   Avoid nesting.

### When to use?

*   Single choice options
*   Shown side-by-side or stacked
*   Where there is space to show them all at once

### When not to use?

*   Don’t use when there is more than 20 options.
*   When choices are mutually exclusive, use a [radio](https://drive.google.com/a/cultureamp.com/open?id=1JzPn1Bl-qvijs1TnllIM6-9uoCfZa-xzwYvBurjwEy8) instead.
*   For settings that are immediately applied, consider using a [toggle switch](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UZ59BbBuIk2JQl9cflUK8lCctqITfWummOEe26E3yyI/edit) instead.
