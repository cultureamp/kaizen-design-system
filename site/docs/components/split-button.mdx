## To keep in mind

Sometimes there’s not enough space for a separate Button and Icon button, and they both control closely related actions. 

*   See [Button](/components/button) guidelines.
*   See [dropdown](/components/dropdown) guidelines.
*   RTL: the segmented chevron appears on the left.

## When to use

Use when there’s not enough space for a separate Button and Icon button, and they both control closely related actions. 

## When not to use

*   Don’t use a button when navigation is involved. Instead, use a [link](/guidelines/links-vs-buttons).
*   Don’t use a split button separate [Button](/components/button) and [Icon button](/components/icon-button) will do.
*   If there’s only 1 action for the dropdown, try to use another button.
