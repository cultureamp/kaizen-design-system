## To keep in mind

Sometimes there’s not enough space for a separate Button and Icon button, and they both control closely related actions.

*   See [Button](/components/button) guidelines.
*   See [dropdown](/components/dropdown) guidelines.
*   RTL: the segmented chevron appears on the left.
*   Focus indicator
    *   See [Interaction states guidelines for focus indicators](/guidelines/interaction-states#focus-indicator).
    *   On keyboard navigation show a focus indicator around the default action, on the next tab show a focus indicator on the chevron action.
    *   For select options show focus indicator on keyboard navigation and on click (not hover)

## When to use and when not to use

<WhenToUseAndWhenNotToUse>
<WhenToUse>

*   Use when there’s not enough space for a separate Button and Icon button, and they both control closely related actions.

</WhenToUse>
<WhenNotToUse>

*   Don’t use a button when navigation is involved. Instead, use a [link](/guidelines/links-vs-buttons).
*   Don’t use a split button separate [Button](/components/button) and [Icon Button](/components/icon-button) will do.
*   If there’s only 1 action for the dropdown, try to use another button.
