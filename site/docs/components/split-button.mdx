## To keep in mind

Sometimes there’s not enough space for a separate Button and Icon button, and they both control closely related actions. 

*   See [Button](https://drive.google.com/a/cultureamp.com/open?id=1xByfF-jYRiQr0rUCPb3PRbajWKzx4vJ4NDE0K7IfMso) guidelines
*   See [dropdown](https://drive.google.com/a/cultureamp.com/open?id=1dFV8rT46N-pZ7rbk0phbxHj6I_SPbdLG1TaM8UZxNpM) guidelines
*   RTL: the segmented chevron appears on the left

### When to use?

Use when there’s not enough space for a separate Button and Icon button, and they both control closely related actions. 

### When not to use?

*   Don’t use a button when navigation is involved. Instead, use a [link](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lp2rta1rkbp9W31EaqnnnsVeUEtuRLhKp3xwPpRsV6U/edit#heading=h.2ocvpvil9swi).
*   Don’t use a split button separate [Button](https://drive.google.com/a/cultureamp.com/open?id=1xByfF-jYRiQr0rUCPb3PRbajWKzx4vJ4NDE0K7IfMso) and [Icon button](https://drive.google.com/a/cultureamp.com/open?id=1JLk1jfIZTJwqiEF4sLkQiY8hMs6A--2gCRncSmTTBrY) will do.
*   If there’s only 1 action for the dropdown, try to use another button.
