needToKnow:
- Components are reusable code used to rapidly build pages. They are the source of truth for our shared User Interface elements.
- These components are flexible, and we continuously develop and grow them to match our evolving product needs.

## To keep in mind

These components accelerate our designers and front-end engineers and show how they behave interactively. Shared components let us reuse existing work and build upon what we have.

## Component design

### Naming things is hard!

Talk to someone in Design Systems team for help on names that work for designers and engineers, as well as respect industry guidelines like W3C specifications, popular frameworks, and so on. For example:

- Name of a component
- Name of props e.g. "mood"–ideally the possible values would be suggested by the prop name. Avoid "type" or "variant" where possible.
- Name of prop values e.g. "affirmative", "destructive"
- Name of sizing options e.g. small/medium/large

### Stand on the shoulders of giants

Where possible, we build on the community of practice around design systems and open-source component libraries. There's no need to reinvent the wheel.

Find 3 examples of someone who's done this before. For example, try [Shopify's Polaris Design System](https://polaris.shopify.com/components/get-started), [Atlassian's Design System](https://www.atlassian.design/), [Salesforce's Lightning Design System](https://www.lightningdesignsystem.com/guidelines/overview/), [Ant Design's System](https://ant.design/), or [Google's Material Design](https://material.io/design/). You might find inspiration for design guidelines, prop names, and implementation details. Look for a component library or framework that's already built what you're considering.


#### Implementation considerations

You might need to consider:

- **Nested HTML**: Will any HTML, such as a link be present? For example, a link in a checkbox label, or a button in a notification paragraph.
- **Text wrapping**: Will there be any text wrapping, breaking, or truncating for user-generated content, such as URLs/emails?
- **RTL**: Does there need to be right-to-left (RTL) options for localization and internationalization?
- **Security**: Are there any possible data confidentiality or security concerns? Consider dummy text.
- **Motion**: Does there need to be motion?
- **Performance**: Consider latency, size, perceived performance, compilation/minification, caching, CDNs, and delivery.
- **Inheritance**: Is there likely to be style inheritance problems with legacy styles, such as Bootstrap?
- **Responsive**: How responsive is it?
- **Accessibility**: How accessible is it? Culture Amp employees can check out [Web Accessibility (Current Compliance, Going Forward, Statement and Answers for Customers)](https://cultureamp.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/Prod/pages/428572998/Web+Accessibility).

#### API Design

##### States

There might be more than 1 dimension of state. In addition to default, hover, focus, active, and disabled states, a component might have other dimensions of states such as a checkbox being checked, unchecked or mixed, or an input being read-only. See the [Interaction states guidelines](/guidelines/interaction-states#disabled-state).

##### Props: noMargin

It is common for components to come with default margins surrounding them and yet these margins can cause problems in app, given surrounding content. For all components that come with default spacing, we provide a `noMargin` boolean prop to turn the default margins off as needed.

##### Props: sizes

Use "Small", "Medium", "Large": in code, `sm`, `md`, `lg`. For more information, see [Sizing guidelines](https://cultureamp.design/guidelines/sizing).


## Component guidelines

### Quality

We strive to achieve the following quality attributes on all of our components:

- **Designed**: Designs for the component have been created and officially added to the UI kit.
- **Documented**: Component has been documented and exists on the Kaizen site.
- **Matches latest design**: Implementation component matches the current design in the UI kit.
- **Has all variants**: Implementation contains all variants designed in UI kit.
- **Responsive**: Contains support for responsiveness, or has responsiveness built-in.
- **Internationalized**: Contains no hard-coded English text that is user facing, and supports usage with right-to-left (RTL) languages.
- **Accessible**: To our best knowledge, the component complies with the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1, Level AA.

The status of these can be found on the documentation page for each component, or on the [Component health](/component-health) page, which shows the status of all components.
