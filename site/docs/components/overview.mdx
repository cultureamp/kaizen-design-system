## Component guidelines

### Stand on the shoulders of giants

Where possible, we build on the community of practice around design systems and open-source component libraries.

Find 3 examples of someone who's done this before. For example, try [Shopify's Polaris Design System](https://polaris.shopify.com/components/get-started), [Atlassian's Design System](https://www.atlassian.design/), [Salesforce's Lightning Design System](https://www.lightningdesignsystem.com/guidelines/overview/), [Ant Design's System](https://ant.design/), or [Google's Material Design](https://material.io/design/). You might find inspiration for design guidelines, prop names, and implementation details. Look for a component library or framework that's already built what you're considering.

### Quality

We strive to achieve the following quality attributes on all of our components:

- **Designed**: Designs for the component have been created and officially added to the UI kit.
- **Documented**: Component has been documented and exists on the Kaizen site.
- **Matches latest design**: Implementation component matches the current design in the UI kit.
- **Has all variants**: Implementation contains all variants designed in UI kit.
- **Responsive**: Contains support for responsiveness, or has responsiveness built-in.
- **Internationalized**: Contains no hard-coded English text that is user facing, and supports usage with right-to-left (RTL) languages.
- **Accessible**: To our best knowledge, the component complies with the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1, Level AA.

The status of these can be found on the documentation page for each component, or on the [Component health](/component-health) page, which shows the status of all components.
