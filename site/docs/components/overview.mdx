## Component guidelines

### Stand on the shoulders of giants

Where possible, we build on the community of practice around design systems and open-source component libraries.

Find 3 examples of someone who's done this before. For example, try [Shopify's Polaris Design System](https://polaris.shopify.com/components/get-started), [Atlassian's Design System](https://www.atlassian.design/), [Salesforce's Lightning Design System](https://www.lightningdesignsystem.com/guidelines/overview/), [Ant Design's System](https://ant.design/), or [Google's Material Design](https://material.io/design/). You might find inspiration for design guidelines, prop names, and implementation details. Look for a component library or framework that's already built what you're considering.

### Quality

We strive to achieve the following quality attributes on all of our components:

- **Designed**: Designs for the component have been created and officially added to the UI kit.
- **Documented**: Component has been documented and exists on the Kaizen site.
- **Matches latest design**: Implementation component matches the current design in the UI kit.
- **Has all variants**: Implementation contains all variants designed in UI kit.
- **Responsive**: Contains support for responsiveness, or has responsiveness built-in.
- **Internationalized**: Contains no hard-coded English text that is user facing, and supports usage with right-to-left (RTL) languages.
- **Accessible**: To our best knowledge, the component complies with the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1, Level AA.

The status of these can be found on the documentation page for each component, or on the [Component health](/component-health) page, which shows the status of all components.

### API
- **Avoid language overloading**: Choose names that are self-describing that continue to be clear in slightly different contexts. For example, `type`, has a specific meaning within the context of a form, but it could also be used to describe a different appearance of a component. A good rule of thumb is to avoid names that are used in HTML.
- **Lean on existing mental models**: Lean into established naming conventions where it makes sense to do so. Things like input `onChange` should not stray from the default behavior that React has defined. 
- **Encapsulation:** Components should only be concerned about their own form and function and not about how they appear in relation to other components.
- **Favor composition**: This allows us to have a more succinct API that encourages code reuse.
- **RTL support**: Avoid using left/right props or values, instead use start/end and support RTL automatically.
- **Allowing ReactNode**: Favor allowing ReactNode values over strings where possible, for greater flexibility.

#### Common props
| Name | Description | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `tag` | Specifies which HTML element the component should render as. | `<Heading tag="h2">` |
| `mood` | [Dictates the tone of the component](https://dev.cultureamp.design/api-guidelines/guidelines/moods/), usually affecting colors. | `<BrandMoment mood="positive">` |
| `primary` / `secondary` / `destructive` | Used to enable these common variants. | `<Button primary>` |
| `reversed` | Enables a version of the component to be used on a dark background. | `<Button reversed>` |
| `variant` | Only used if none of the above props makes sense.  | `<TextAreaField variant="prominent">` |
