## To keep in mind

A default icon button indicates to a user that they can perform an inline action on this page, such as:

- Apply an action to an object, e.g. save, delete, add an item, undo, create a new item.
- Trigger a new element to appear on the page e.g. toggle additional information, open a modal.

Other considerations:

- Icon buttons use a button element (not a link element and no `role="button"`):
- All buttons have an `aria-label` to describe the action to people using assistive technologies, such as screen readers:
    - No more than 2 to 3 words long.
    - Use verbs first; use only verbs where possible e.g. “Save”.
    - Avoid unnecessary words and articles, such as “the” or “a”.
    - Use sentence case.
- New icons used as icon buttons need to be user tested to test comprehension—can the user identify the action indicated by the icon?
- If there's any doubt about comprehension, a tooltip must be used on hover/focus of the icon button.
- Icons used in icon buttons are, by default, 20px in size (minimum) and can be scaled to larger sizes if it contextually makes sense.
- Icon buttons have a minimum touch zone of 48px.
- RTL: flip the direction of arrow icons when the user is using a right-to-left language.

### Breadcrumb icon button

A breadcrumb icon button uses a link element instead of a button and navigates to another page.

### Interaction guidelines

| Icon color | Disabled    | Default/Inactive | Hover/Focus | Active/Pressed |
| ---------- | ----------- | ---------------- | ----------- | -------------- |
| Ink        | 30% opacity | 50% opacity      | 70% opacity | 100% opacity   |
| White      | 30% opacity | 50% opacity      | 70% opacity | 100% opacity   |
| Ocean      | 30% opacity | 50% opacity      | 70% opacity | 100% opacity   |

In CSS, “Default/Inactive” maps to `initial` style, “Hover/Focus” to `:hover` and `:focus`, and “Active/Pressed” to `:active`.

## When to use and when not to use

<DosAndDonts>
<Do>

- Use an icon button when a user can perform an inline action on this page and there's no room for a default button. Icon buttons are often used when there are 2 or 3 adjacent icons buttons that perform actions on a single item presented in a row.

</Do>
<Dont>

- To display icons that do not have actions associated with them, use the [Icon](/components/icon) component.
- Avoid using more than 1 icon button in a [table](/components/table) row.
- When there's enough space, use a [button](/components/button) instead.

</Dont>
</DosAndDonts>
