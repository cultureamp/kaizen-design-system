## To keep in mind

When you are notifying a user of the outcome of an action they have taken, provide visual feedback with a Toast Notification.

*   It is used immediately after a specific event, such as a user action that does not relate to a specific object on the page. E.g. Confirmation of deleted items.
*   They appear a grid unit below the [Title Block](/components/title-block).
    *   That is, the top edge of the toast notification is a grid unit lower than the bottom edge of the title block.
    *   If you are scrolled down the page, the toast will still show.
*   **Animation**:
    *   Enters from the top–right of the viewport (or top–left in right-to-left languages) and exits back to where it came from.
*   **Multiple** toasts can be shown at the same time, vertically stacked with a [grid unit](/components/spacing) in between. The latest messages appears at the top.
*   **System or user triggered**:
    *   System: e.g. an unexpected error occurs such as event commands failing in event sourced surveys
    *   User-triggered: all other notifications.
*   Dismissible or persistent:
    *   Use **Persistent** notifications when the information continues to be relevant after the task is complete.
    *   Use **Dismissible** notifications when the information has been acknowledged and the message is no longer relevant.
*   Anatomy:
    *   **Heading**: summarizes the message (optimized for quick scanning). This relates directly to the message. Do not use generic language such as “Success”, “Error”, etc.
    *   **Description**: succinct description that is a standalone sentence (that is, it does not run on from the heading).
    *   **Call to action** (optional): hyperlinks can be included to provide the user with a clear call to action.
*   Why’s it called a toast?
    *   Traditionally “toast” notifications in products have “popped up” from the bottom of the screen on mobile devices, like a slice of toast in a toaster. There are also “snackbars”!

## When to use and when not to use

<WhenToUseAndWhenNotToUse>
<WhenToUse>

*   When you are notifying a user of an action they have taken and need to provide visual feedback.
*   It is used immediately after a specific event such as a user action that does not relate to an object on the page. For example, confirmation of deleted items.
*   **Positive**:
    *   E.g. a notification about deleting successfully is positive because the user’s intended action was successful.
*   **Informative**
    *   TODO: Add images and examples here
*   **Cautionary**
    *   TODO: Add images and examples here

</WhenToUse>
<WhenNotToUse>

*   When you are speaking directly to a piece of content, use [Inline Notifications](/components/inline-notification) which can be positioned closer to it.
*   When a message applies at a system level or does not apply to a specific piece of content and it needs to alert all users, use [Global Notifications](/components/global-notification).
*   When an action is user triggered and you need to inform the user, use a [Confirmation Modal](/components/modal) with relevant [Mood](/guidelines/moods), e.g. Informative Confirmation Modal
