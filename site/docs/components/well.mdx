## Options

*   Mood:
    *   Default
    *   Positive
    *   Informative
    *   Cautionary
    *   Negative
*   Border style:
    *   Solid
    *   Dashed
    *   None

## To keep in mind

* We need boundaries to define or contextualise secondary content. Wells can provide a way to do this visually.
* An Empty State Well defines an area that doesn’t currently have content, but could.
* A Drag & Drop Well provides a visible target to drop content into.
* An Internal Content Well helps to define, divide or shape content within a card.
* An External Content Well wraps one or more cards or pieces of content into a group.

### When not to use

*   For primary content, use a [Card](https://drive.google.com/a/cultureamp.com/open?id=1ErRhNAZsOSx4gHV1TCUuaZoK9v16ytN_XKkjElOfnNo) instead.
*   Don’t use a well inside well (even if there is a card separating them)
*   Don’t use as a [Notification](https://drive.google.com/a/cultureamp.com/open?id=1rjUY9ht0IkulRpy3RW3hma9RYnZa-m7jIar-tqroTBs)
*   Don’t use as a [Tooltip](https://drive.google.com/a/cultureamp.com/open?id=1yv_dAWWd4inPBi7anZOGRC5SRbGOSdaXjggg9Q9lzPI)
