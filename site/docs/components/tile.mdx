    *   **Information** (optional)
        *   Object with three parameters: text, primaryAction (optional), secondaryAction (optional)
        *   Causes Information IconButton to appear in upper right corner. When clicked the backside of Tile is revealed.
        *   Text params is rendered a paragraph, primaryAction and secondaryAction action rendered as buttons.
