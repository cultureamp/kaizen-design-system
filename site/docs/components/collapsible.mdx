summaryParagraph: Collapsibles are used to collapse and expand content inline on a page. This lets users progressively disclose information as desired.

needToKnow:
  - "We usually start collapsibles in a collapsed position by default so that users can see what's available."
  - "We often avoid accordions, which are a specific type of collapsible that allows only 1 section open at a time and is often an annoying constraint on user interaction."

### UI Kit

<iframe style="border: none;" width="744" height="450" src="https://www.figma.com/embed?embed_host=share&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.figma.com%2Ffile%2FeZKEE5kXbEMY3lx84oz8iN%2F%E2%9D%A4%EF%B8%8F-UI-Kit%3A-Heart%3Fnode-id%3D20982%253A79240" allowfullscreen></iframe>

## Options

* Collapsible group: a group of related collapsible sections that may be combined or separated by whitespace.
* Single collapsible: a standalone collapsible for 1 item of content.
* Header:
  * Default header: provide plain text for a title to use default styling.
  * Custom header: supply your own header content and styling for the header and title.
* Lazy-loading: when handling lots of data, you might lazy load collapsible content for performance reasons. This might limit animation.
* Sticky header: when the user scrolls down a long way, they can keep context of where they are by looking at the sticky header. They may also collapse a long section easily using the sticky header.

We don't yet support:

* Accordion: a collapsible group that only allows 1 section to be open at a time.
* Show/hide button for outside of the collapsible group.

## To keep in mind

* Chevron:
  * We only support chevron on the right. We show a downwards chevron when section is closed and upwards when open.
* Avoid multi-level expansions.
* Animation: we animate expansion using a reveal animation (see [animation](/guidelines/animation) for guidance on timing and variable height animations).

## When to use and when not to use

<WhenToUseAndWhenNotToUse>
<WhenToUse>

* Use collapsibles when many users want an overview and some users want to dig into specific parts.
* Use accordion when it’s extremely important to focus on one single thing at a time.

</WhenToUse>
<WhenNotToUse>

* Use a [Table](/components/table) when there’s a consistent heading and tabular data.

</WhenNotToUse>

* You might want to show and hide text with truncation using a control that says “Show more” or similar. We don't yet support that and it might belong to the Text component instead.
