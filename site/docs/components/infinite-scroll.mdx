needToKnow:
  - Perform usability testing to decide where to split content into pages (that is, how much content to show per page).

## To keep in mind

Traditionally, Infinite Scroll loads and presents more results as you scroll without interruption, in a single stream. To minimize some drawbacks of this, however, we use a "View more" [Button](/components/button) that a user must click to progressively disclose only as much content as they want.

- Compare [Pagination and Infinite Scroll](/guidelines/pagination-infinite-scroll).
- Show a [Loading Spinner](/components/loading-spinner) below the list to indicate that items have been requested, either in the "View more" button or in the space they'll load.
- Button text:
    - Instead of "load more", which describes what the system is doing, use "View more" to describe what the person is doing.
    - Where appropriate, specify the object to further clarify what the action will do. For example, use "View more comments" when loading more comments.
    - Where appropriate, indicate how many additional items will be loaded, such as "View 50 more comments". Where possible, pluralize it correctly so that it says "View 1 more comment" when there's only 1 comment remaining.
- Consider if you need to keep the person's place in the loaded content when they refresh their browser page or navigate backwards and forwards through browser history.
- To decide where to split content into sections, consider:
    - Page and data load time
    - Amount of content in each entry
    - Screen real estate
    - How many items a person may need to compare at once
- After someone has tapped "view more" several times, it might end up becoming a long page:
    - You might consider helping users keep context by using, for example, a sticky header, such as when you have long [Collapsible](/components/collapsible) sections.
    - You might consider giving users a method to efficiently exit the stream, such as letting them collapse a sticky [Collapsible](/components/collapsible) section or provide a persistent link to access the next action they must perform.
    - Be mindful of performance for extremely long pages on browsers and devices with fewer resources.

## When to use and when not to use

<DosAndDonts>
<Do>

- Use "View more" when someone may want to see every item and compare them at the same time.
- Use "View more" when we want and expect people to read more than 1 page worth of content without disrupting the experience with a page load.
- On small and touch devices, "View more" can feel more efficient than pagination.

</Do>
<Dont>

- Use [Pagination](/components/pagination) when people are unlikely to need to see ALL the content.
- Use [Pagination](/components/pagination) when the first page is enough.
- Use [Pagination](/components/pagination) when bookmarking a specific page is important.
- Consider using [Pagination](/components/pagination) when there's lot of screen real estate.
- Consider using [Pagination](/components/pagination) when a list contains more than 50 items of a single line of text each.

</Dont>

## Research insights

In the Comments report, we saw a sharp drop off from page 1 to page 2 when we used pagination. When we introduced question grouping and a "View more" button, we saw more viewers viewing page 2.
