title: Progress Bar
navTitle: Progress Bar (not built)
summaryParagraph: Progress bars show continuous progress through a process, such as a percentage value. They show how much progress is complete and how much remains.
tags: ["Progress", "Progress bar", "Progress indicator", "Progress tracker", "Loading bar", "Loader"]
needToKnow:
- Give people feedback about progress.
- A static progress bar shows current progress through a process that will not progress without user interaction.
- A loading progress bar shows current progress through a loading process that the system will progress by itself without user interaction. We use animation to show that the system is operating.

## Options

- Static process or loading progress:
    - **Static**: a static progress bar shows current progress through a process that will not progress without user interaction.
    - **Loading**: a loading progress bar shows current progress through a loading process that the system will progress by itself without user interaction. We use animation to show that the system is operating.
- Props:
    - Min
    - Max
    - Initial value
    - Infinite/indeterminate
- [Moods](/guidelines/moods): positive, informative, cautionary, negative

## To keep in mind

Give people feedback with progress bars.

- Anatomy:
    - **Progress track:** This track shows the path the progress bar will take.
    - **Progress bar fill:** This shows the completed progress visually as a colored bar.
    - **Progress value:** This shows the completed progress as text, usually a percentage. Sometimes a fraction or ratio may be shown.
    - **Progress label:** This describes the process that's in action.
- Use **loading progress bars** for system processes, such as downloading, uploading, or processing.
- Start progress bars on 1% instead of 0% to show the process has started, where it makes sense.
- A progress bar is not interactive.
- Avoid using indeterminate progress bars. Try to estimate how long a process will take or how many items it will process. A progress bar may start with an unknown amount of progress, then become determinate.
- In right-to-left (RTL) languages, start the progress bar fill from the right and fill towards the left as progress increases.
- Accessibility:
    - Use the `progressbar` `role` to show that the element displays progress status.
    - Use the `aria-valuenow`, `aria-valuemin`, and `aria-valuemax` attributes to indicate progress completion.

## When to use and when not to use

<WhenToUseAndWhenNotToUse>
<WhenToUse>

- Use a progress bar when it will give people feedback in a long-running process with continuous values.

</WhenToUse>
<WhenNotToUse>

- For an unknown amount of time/progress, consider using a [loading spinner](/components/loading-spinner) instead.
- For loading content in a module, consider using a [loading skeleton](/components/loading-skeleton) instead.
- For discrete steps, consider using a progress stepper instead.
- For an interactive element that lets people provide input to show progress, use a range slider.
