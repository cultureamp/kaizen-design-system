## To keep in mind

Dividers separate content into clear groups. This helps people navigate the information hierarchy. 

* We use full-bleed dividers in lists/menus and middle dividers to group or separate content.
* They inherit the background color they sit on, hence the need for an opacity (alpha).

### When to use

* When whitespace is not enough of a separator.
* In lists, separate items to show they are individual and unrelated items when each item is long and otherwise difficult to scan.
* In layouts, when background color changes (e.g. from stone to white)

### When not to use

* For surrounding an item, use a [border](./border).
* For grouping content, use a [card](./card) or [table row](./table-row) or [well](./well).
