## To keep in mind
- Needs to be visually distinguishable from the product UI. It is recommended that commentaries adopt the Prominent mood (Purple 100) to contain the message.
- Must be tied to content to summarize the page, and should not float independently on the page
- Must not overwhelm the content. If lengthy, consider truncating the majority of the commentary behind a disclosure (e.g. read more) or [collapsible function](https://cultureamp.design/components/collapsible/).
- Must have an identity (individual and/or company, or explicitly anonymous) tied to the commentary, by including the person/company avatar, name and if referring to an individual, their role/position.
- Avoid the use of personal pronouns (like ‘we’) in surrounding microcopy to minimise confusion around who is speaking in the annotation (Culture Amp or the user).
- Editing commentaries will depend on the workflow. Linking to an edit page with a rich-text editor is the preferred default, until inline editing has been defined (TBD).
