## To keep in mind

- While a minimum of 1 Avatar is required, this component should ideally be used with multiple Avatars to make use of the counter and list functionality.
- Unlike the Avatar component, there are only three sizes available for an Avatar Group.
- The counter will only appear if the number of Avatars exceed the maxVisible value.

## When to use and when not to use

<WhenToUseAndWhenNotToUse>
<WhenToUse>

- Use the Avatar Group to help people efficiently identify a group of individuals or companies in the platform visually.
- Use the Avatar Group if you want a efficient way to change the maximum avatars visible, ie: on screen resize.
- Use the Avatar Group to distinguish people or companies with the same names.

</WhenToUse>
<WhenNotToUse>

- Avoid an Avatar Group when most individuals or companies won't have an image to show.
- Aboid an Avatar Group when you only have one individual or company.
