title: Progress Stepper
navTitle: Progress Stepper
summaryParagraph: Progress steppers show discrete progress through a process, such as numbers 1–4. They show how much progress is complete and how much remains, divided into equal steps.
tags: ["Progress bar", "Progress tracker", "Progress indicator"]
needToKnow:
- Progress steppers may be vertical or horizontal.
- Progress steppers may be gated or ungated.
- A step may show validation feedback.
- Aim for 3–4 steps.

## Visuals

Coming soon.

## Options

- Gated or ungated:
    - **Gated:** In a gated progress stepper, later steps depend on completion of earlier steps. The user must navigate through them in order, typically through adjacent buttons in a workflow.
    - **Ungated:** In an ungated progress stepper, steps can be completed in any order. The user can navigate to any step directly by the step's link.
- Orientation: **Horizontal** or **Vertical**
- **Linked** or **unlinked**:
    - Steps may be linked and receive keyboard focus or unlinked and not receive focus.
- **Validation feedback**:
    - A step may indicate an error in a negative mood or a warning in a cautionary [mood](/guidelines/mood).

## Copy guidelines

Use step labels to clearly describe the purpose of the step. Set expectations about what's available in that step.

### Keep step labels concise

Use only 1 word where possible.

<DoAndDontContainer>
<Do>

- Settings
- Questions
- Employees

</Do>

<Dont>

- Configure your settings
- Ask questions
- Add employees

</Dont>
</DoAndDontContainer>

### Consistently use nouns or verbs through all steps

Avoid mixing nouns and verbs in step labels.

<DoAndDontContainer>
<Do>

- Settings
- Questions
- Employees

</Do>

<Dont>

- Configure
- Questions
- Add

</Dont>
</DoAndDontContainer>

### Step labels use the same terminology as the page they link to

For example, don’t use ‘Export’ in the page title of a Workflow and have a step label of ‘Download’.

## To keep in mind

Give people feedback about progress through a process and keep them on track. Use progress steppers to break a larger goal into manageable steps.

- Anatomy:
    - **Progress track:** This line links the steps together in a gated progress stepper.
    - **Current step:** This shows the step that the user is on.
    - **Upcoming step:** This shows a step beyond the user, closer to completion.
    - **Completed step:** This shows a step the user has already completed, closer to the beginning.
    - **Disabled:** A grayed-out label indicates a step that users can not revisit.
    - **Step label:** This describes the purpose of the step.
    - **Step indicator:** The circle or dot icon that indicates the step.
- Responsive behavior:
    - On small screens, consider hiding step labels and showing only step indicators.
- Use 2–6 steps:
    - Aim for 3–4 steps.
    - If a workflow needs more than 6 steps, consider how you might simplify it or break it up into multiple tasks.

## When to use and when not to use

<WhenToUseAndWhenNotToUse>
<WhenToUse>

- Use progress steppers to break a larger goal into manageable steps when it would otherwise be overwhelming.
- Use progress steppers to show tasks completed.

</WhenToUse>
<WhenNotToUse>

- For continuous values, use a [progress bar](/component/progress-bar) instead.
- For an interactive element that lets people provide input increase numbers in equal steps, use a input stepper, such as a [Text Field](/components/text-field) with number input and [Buttons](/components/button) to increase and decrease values.
