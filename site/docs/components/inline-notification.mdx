## Options

*   Modes:
    *   Persistent
    *   Dismissible

*   Lines:
    *   Single-line: inline/adjacent heading and body
    *   Multi-line: stacked heading and body

## To keep in mind

*   Inline Notifications are used for contextual information, including positive feedback or confirmation about an action, warnings about possible issues or show-stopping errors.
*   They are used to provide context in close **proximity** to a piece of content.
*   Inline notifications can be **system or user triggered**.
*   Dismissible or persistent:
    *   Use **Persistent** notifications when the information continues to be relevant after the message is shown, e.g. Defining the reporting size on an Insight report
    *   Use **Dismissible** notifications when the information has been acknowledged and the message is no longer relevant, e.g. helpfully updating formatting for user input data.
*   Anatomy:
    *   **Heading**: summarizes the message. This relates directly to the message. Do not use generic language such as “Success”, “Error”, etc.
    *   **Description**: succinct description that is a standalone sentence (that is, it does not run on from the heading).
    *   **Call to action** (optional): hyperlinks can be included to provide the user with a clear call to action.
*   What’s an **autohide**?
    *   TODO: add details

## When not to use

*   When a message applies at a system level or does not apply to a specific piece of content and it needs to alert all users, use [Global Notifications](/components/global-notification)
*   When you are notifying a user of an action they have taken, provide visual feedback with a [Toast Notification](/components/toast-notification).
*   When an action is user triggered and you need to inform the user, use a [Confirmation Modal](/components/modal) with relevant [Mood](/guidelines/mood), e.g. Informative Confirmation Modal

## See also

*   **Global Notification: **A [Global Notification](/components/global-notification) is a message object used for system-level notifications that inform the user about system status such as logging in and background processes like data imports.
*   **Toast Notification**: [Toasts](/components/toast-notification) appear in the top–right (or top–left in right-to-left languages). It is used immediately after a specific event such as a user action that does not relate to an object on the page. For example, confirmation of deleted items.
