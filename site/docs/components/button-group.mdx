## To keep in mind

A button group contains buttons that indicate to a user that they can perform actions on an object, such as:

*   Apply an action to an object, e.g. save, delete, add an item, undo, create a new item
*   Trigger the next step in a process


*   Default button groups:
    *   Follow [button](/components/button) principles.
    *   These use extremely closely related actions on a single object.
*   Toggle button groups
    *   For an example of a toggle button group, consider Bold/Italic/Underline in a text editor.
    *   Follow [button](/components/button) principles.
    *   If using icon buttons, follow [icon button](/components/icon-button) principles too.
    *   Mutually exclusive settings, such as choosing left, centered, or right aligned text.

    
*   Focus indicator
    *  See [Interaction states guidelines for focus indicators](/guidelines/interaction-states#focus-indicator).
    *  Must show focus indicator on each button on keyboard navigation, but not on click.


## When to use and when not to use

<WhenToUseAndWhenNotToUse>
<WhenToUse>

- Use when there’s not enough space for separate buttons or they control the one setting.
- Use when all the actions in the group take place immediately on click. For example, if one or more actions does not immediately apply on click, then either use a different component, or remove that action from the group. If a subsequent button press is required, consider using a [radio group](/components/radio-group) instead.
- Use when the buttons can all be described by one related action. For example, in options to add to calendar, ICS and Google Cal are both options to add to calendar.

</WhenToUse>
<WhenNotToUse>

- Don’t use a button group when there’s space for separate buttons.
- Don’t use a button group when switching between content or object pages. Use [tabs](/components/tabs) instead.
