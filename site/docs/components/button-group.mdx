## To keep in mind

A button group contains buttons that indicate to a user that they can perform actions on an object, such as:

*   Apply an action to an object, e.g. save, delete, add an item, undo, create a new item
*   Trigger the next step in a process


*   Default button groups: 
    *   Follow [button](https://drive.google.com/a/cultureamp.com/open?id=1xByfF-jYRiQr0rUCPb3PRbajWKzx4vJ4NDE0K7IfMso) principles.
    *   These use extremely closely related actions on a single object.
*   Toggle button groups
    *   Follow [button](https://drive.google.com/a/cultureamp.com/open?id=1xByfF-jYRiQr0rUCPb3PRbajWKzx4vJ4NDE0K7IfMso) principles.
    *   If using icon buttons, follow [icon button](https://drive.google.com/a/cultureamp.com/open?id=1JLk1jfIZTJwqiEF4sLkQiY8hMs6A--2gCRncSmTTBrY) principles too.
    *   Mutually exclusive settings, such as choosing left, centered, or right aligned text.
