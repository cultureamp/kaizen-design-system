## Options

Modes:

*   Persistent
*   Dismissible

## To keep in mind

Global Notifications are used to inform the user of system level messages.

*   Anatomy:
    *   **Description**: a succinct description to inform the user.
    *   **Call to action** (optional): hyperlinks can be included to provide the user with a clear call to action.
    *   Unlike other notifications, the Global Notification does not require a heading, to ensure the whole message is considered critical. 
*   Styles:
    *   They are visually different to other notifications, to ensure screen prominence and importance. 
    *   A Global Notification is always positioned at the top of the screen (above the Navigation Bar) and stretches the full width of the viewport.
*   Global notifications are system triggered, not user triggered.
*   Dismissible or persistent:
    *   Use **Persistent** notifications when the information continues to be relevant to the next task, e.g. The server is down, all pages will continue to be broken.
    *   Use **Dismissible** notifications when the information has been acknowledged and the message is no longer relevant to the next task, e.g. your data import successfully finished. Refreshing the page on dismissible notifications will not remove them

## When to use and when not to use

</WhenToUse>
<WhenNotToUse>

*   When you are speaking directly to a piece of content, use [Inline Notifications](/components/inline-notification) which can be positioned closer to it.
*   When you are notifying a user of an action they have taken, provide visual feedback with a [Toast Notification](/components/toast-notification).
*   When an action is user triggered and you need to inform the user, use a [Confirmation Modal](/components/modal) with relevant [Mood](/guidelines/moods), e.g. Informative Confirmation Modal
