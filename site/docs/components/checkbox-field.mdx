## To keep in mind

*   Ensure both label and input are clickable to select the checkbox field. That is, use `label` tags that wrap the `input` element or use a `for` attribute.

### When to use?

*   For a single opt-in choice: show one checkbox field.

### When not to use?

*   For a few options: show two or more checkbox fields in a [Checkbox Group](https://drive.google.com/a/cultureamp.com/open?id=1cFJCkMegiTbY-ToMicfwZIltVAIetRl4JVpH3JXCh3E).
*   Don’t use when there is more than 20 options.
*   When choices are mutually exclusive, use a [radio](https://drive.google.com/a/cultureamp.com/open?id=1JzPn1Bl-qvijs1TnllIM6-9uoCfZa-xzwYvBurjwEy8) instead.
*   For settings that are immediately applied, consider using a [toggle switch](#) instead.
