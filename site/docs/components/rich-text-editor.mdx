## To keep in mind
- The output of a Rich Text Editor can appear in the context of a larger page, and can present information that comes from a user rather than the system. In support of this:
    - We offer only limited formatting options.
    - If the content being edited is part of a wider page, users should have the ability to preview that content in context.
- For accessibility, there is a single tab key stop for the button groups in the toolbar, and the left and right arrows are used to navigate through each button.
- Focus indicator
    - See [Interaction states guidelines for focus indicators](/guidelines/interaction-states#focus-indicator).
    - On keyboard navigation and when clicking into the text field show the focus indicator around the entire rich text editor component.

## Formatting controls

Formatting controls of the same type are visually grouped to distinguish them. There are 4 types of format controls:

1. **Character format**
    - Bold
    - Italic
    - Underline
2. **Paragraph format**
    - Headings (With a maximum of 3 levels: H1, H2, H3)
    - Bulleted lists
    - Numbered lists
3. **Insert**
    - Images
    - Links
    - Variables
4. **Clear formatting**

## Interactions
- Character formatting is applied to any selected text/characters.
- Paragraph formatting is applied to the entire paragraph surrounding the selection or cursor.
- Common formatting functions (like bold, italic) have commonly understood keyboard bindings or shortcuts that we will support. These shortcuts will be shown as tooltips on the button action.
    - **Bold:** &#8984;+b (Mac) Ctrl+b (Windows)
    - **Italic:** &#8984;+i (Mac) Ctrl+i (Windows)
    - **Underline:** &#8984;+u (Mac) Ctrl+u (Windows)
    - **Link:** &#8984;+k (Mac) Ctrl+k (Windows)
- No right click functionality (i.e context menus)

#### Adding a link
- Highlight the text, click the link icon and add a URL to the dialog.
- To preview the link, highlight the linked text.
- To edit a link, highlight the linked text and choose to edit the URL.
- To delete a link, highlight the linked text and choose delete.

#### Adding a variable
- Place your cursor/caret where you want to insert the variable.
- Select a variable from the list.
- The variable will appear in the text area as tag displaying the variable name, and an example of the data.
- Upon saving & previewing, the tag will be substituted with the corresponding data.
- Use backspace/delete to remove the variable.

#### Adding an image
- (Not yet built)

## Minimum defaults
- For a consistent experience across the product, all rich text editors should at least have the default set of formatting controls:
    - Bold
    - Italic
    - Underline
    - Bulleted & numbered lists

## When to use and when not to use

<WhenToUseAndWhenNotToUse>
<WhenToUse>

- Use a Rich Text Editor when the input is to be consumed by other users, and control over the look and feel of the content is needed for a clear message.

</WhenToUse>
<WhenNotToUse>

- The user doesnâ€™t need control over the look & feel of the input text:
    - If the input is short, consider using a [Text Field](/components/text-field/).
    - If input is longer consider using a [Text Area Field](/components/text-area-field/).
- Collecting information that in a configuration or setting.
- For end users who are responding to questions in a Prominent Text Field, consider using WYSIWYG-lite.
