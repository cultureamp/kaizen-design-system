## To keep in mind
- The output of a Rich Text Editor can appear in the context of a larger page, and can present information that comes from a user rather than the system. In support of this: 
    - We offer only limited formatting options. 
    - If the content being edited is part of a wider page, users should have the ability to preview that content in context. 
- For accessibility, there is a single tab key stop for the button groups in the toolbar, and the left and right arrows are used to navigate through each button.

## Formatting controls
- There are 4 types of format controls.
- Formatting controls of the same type are visually grouped to distinguish them.

**1. Character formatting**
- Bold
- Italic
- Underline

**2. Paragraph formatting** 
- Headings (With a maximum of 3 levels: H1, H2, H3)
- Bulleted lists
- Numbered lists

**3. Insert content**
- Images
- Links
- Variables

**4. Clear formatting**

## Interactions
- Character formatting is applied to any selected text/characters.
- Paragraph formatting is applied to the entire paragraph surrounding the selection or cursor.  
- Common formatting functions (like bold, italic) have commonly understood keyboard bindings or shortcuts that we will support. These shortcuts will be shown as tooltips on the button action.
    - Bold: Mac `&#8984; + b` Windows `Ctrl + b`
    - Italic: Mac `&#8984; + i` & Windows `Ctrl + i`
    - Underline: Mac `&#8984; + u` & Windows `Ctrl + u`
    - Link: Mac `&#8984; + k` & Windows `Ctrl + k`
- No right click functionality (i.e context menus)

#### Adding a link
- Highlight the text, click the link icon and add a URL to the dialog.
- To preview the link, highlight the linked text.
- To edit a link, highlight the linked text and choose to edit the URL. 
- To delete a link, highlight the linked text and choose delete.

#### Adding a variable
- Place your cursor/caret where you want to insert the variable.
- Select a variable from the list.
- The variable will appear in the text area as tag displaying the variable name, and an example of the data.
- Upon saving & previewing, the tag will be substituted with the corresponding data.
- Use backspace/delete to remove the variable.

#### Adding an image

## Minimum defaults
- For a consistent experience across the product, all rich text editors should at least have the default set of formatting controls: 
    - Bold
    - Italics
    - Underline
    - Bulleted & numbered lists

## When to use and when not to use

<WhenToUseAndWhenNotToUse>
<WhenToUse>

- Use a Rich Text Editor when the input is to be consumed by other users, and control over the look and feel of the content is needed for a clear message.

</WhenToUse>
<WhenNotToUse>

- The user doesn’t need control over the look & feel of the input text:
    - If the input is short, consider using a [Text Field](/components/text-field/).
    - If input is longer consider using a [Text Area Field](/components/text-area-field/).
- Collecting information that in a configuration or setting.
- For end users who are responding to questions in a Prominent Text Field, consider using WYSIWYG-lite.
