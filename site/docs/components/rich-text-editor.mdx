## To keep in mind
- The output of a Rich Text Editor can appear in the context of a larger page, and can present information that comes from a user rather than the system. In support of this: 
    - We offer only limited formatting options. 
    - If the content being edited is part of a wider page, users should have the ability to preview that content in context. 
- For accessibility, there is a single tab key stop for the button groups in the toolbar, and the left and right arrows are used to navigate through each button.

## Formatting controls
- There are 4 types of format controls.
- Formatting controls of the same type are visually grouped to distinguish them.

### 1. Character formatting
- Bold
- Italic
- Underline

### 2. Paragraph formatting 
- Headings (With a maximum of 3 levels: H1, H2, H3)
- Bulleted lists
- Numbered lists

### 3. Insert content
- Images
- Links
- Variables

### 4. Clear formatting

## Interactions
- Character formatting is applied to any selected text/characters.
- Paragraph formatting is applied to the entire paragraph surrounding the selection or cursor.  
- Common formatting functions (like bold, italic) have commonly understood keyboard bindings or shortcuts that we will support. These shortcuts will be shown as tooltips on the button action.
    - Bold: Mac (Cmd + b) Windows (Ctrl + b)
    - Italic: Mac (Cmd + i) Windows (Ctrl + i)
    - Underline:  Mac (Cmd + u) Windows (Ctrl + u)
    - Link:  Mac (Cmd + k) Windows (Ctrl + k)
- No right click functionality (i.e context menus)

#### Adding a link
- Highlight the text, click the link icon and add a URL to the dialog.
- To preview the link, highlight the linked text.
- To edit a link, highlight the linked text and choose to edit the URL. 
- To delete a link, highlight the linked text and choose delete.

#### Adding a variable
- Place your cursor/caret where you want to insert the variable.
- Select a variable from the list.
- The variable will appear in the text area as tag displaying the variable name, and an example of the data.
- Upon saving & previewing, the tag will be substituted with the corresponding data.
- Use backspace/delete to remove the variable.

#### Adding an image

## Minimum defaults
- For a consistent experience across the product, all rich text editors should at least have the default set of formatting controls: 
    - Bold
    - Italics
    - Underline
    - Bulleted & numbered lists
