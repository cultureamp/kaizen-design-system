## To keep in mind

A radio lets a user choose to select a single item. When used in a [Radio Group](https://drive.google.com/a/cultureamp.com/open?id=1Kp6SzXex7h7vB6Rx2C3mgEpA6m8043aTSGoQsRYGyaM), a radio lets a user make exactly one selection from a set, which is all visible at the same time.

There must always be more than one radio used together in a [radio group](https://drive.google.com/a/cultureamp.com/open?id=1Kp6SzXex7h7vB6Rx2C3mgEpA6m8043aTSGoQsRYGyaM).

*   Ensure both label and input are clickable to select the radio. That is, use `label` tags that wrap the `input` element or use a `for` attribute.

### When to use?

*   Use radios when a radio group needs items.

### When not to use?

*   When there’s limited space, consider using a select dropdown instead.
*   For settings that are immediately applied, consider using a [toggle switch](https://drive.google.com/a/cultureamp.com/open?id=1UZ59BbBuIk2JQl9cflUK8lCctqITfWummOEe26E3yyI) instead.
