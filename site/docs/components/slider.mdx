## To keep in mind

Sliders are helpful for choosing subjective values.

- Always indicate the current, selected value. Ideally with visible text associated with the handle, but at a minimum provide a text alternative for screen readers.
- Provide a visible label describing what the slider changes, such as "Brightness".
- Show the minimum value on the left and maximum value on the right, where these are reversed in Right-To-Left (RTL) languages.
- We generally use sliders with no fill. You might use a fill when it's useful to give the impression of building towards the maximum value.
- We only use horizontal sliders. We're yet to need a vertical slider.
- We only use sliders with a single handle. We're unlikely to need a slider with more than one handle.

### Style

- Tick marks:
    - For a fine-grained range, you might consider hiding tick marks to minimize visual clutter. For example, a range of 0%–100% with 1% steps would have too many ticks and be incredibly crowded.
    - For a coarse range, where the slider may snap to widely spaced intervals, you might show a tick mark for every step so it is clear where the slider will snap to.
- Tick labels:
    - There's rarely a need to apply labels to every tick mark. Consider only showing a label for min, max, and middle ticks, such as 0%, 100%, and maybe 50%.

### Behavior

- Use a `step` number to set the granularity that the slider values snap to. A good default step is 1 to stick to whole numbers.
- Consider pairing the slider with a [Text Field](/components/text-field) as an alternative input control.

### Accessibility

For a custom slider:

- Use the `slider` `role` to show that the element displays selects a value from within a given range.
- Use the `aria-valuenow`, `aria-valuemin`, and `aria-valuemax` attributes to indicate progress completion.
- Use the `aria-valuetext` attribute to show a text label associated with a given value.
- Ensure a large touch target for selecting the handle.

### Keyboard

- The slider must be keyboard focusable and operable, and RTL languages reverse the direction of arrows. Usually:
    - Right and Up arrows increase the selected value
    - Left and Down arrows decrease the selected value

## When to use and when not to use

<WhenToUseAndWhenNotToUse>
<WhenToUse>

- Use a slider when an imprecise selection makes sense. For example, you might use a slider to ask someone to rate how they're feeling or adjust settings, such as brightness or volume.
- Use a slider when changing the value has an immediate effect. If applying the setting requires pressing a confirmation button, consider using a [Radio Group](/components/radio-group) instead.

</WhenToUse>
<WhenNotToUse>

- For selecting precise values, consider using a [Text Field](/components/text-field), [Radio Group](/components/radio-group), or [Select](/components/select) instead.
- For large ranges e.g. 0–1000, use a [Text Field](/components/text-field) instead.
- For small ranges e.g. 1–3, use a [Radio Group](/components/radio-group) or [Select](/components/select) instead.
