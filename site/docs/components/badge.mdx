### Options

*   Known or unknown number:
    *   Number badge
    *   Dot badge

## To keep in mind

We want to draw attention to a specific value

*   The badge text can be a number or a number with text like “10x” for a multiplier

### When to use?

*   Use **badges** for **counts** of important information, close to the relevant item.
*   A **dot badge** notifies the user that something is new or updated without showing a count, such as an “unread report”, or activity notification. It may be useful as a less prominent badge, even when the count is known.
*   Use badges to notify or draw attention to changed values or status.
*   Use a [“pop” animation style](http://www.cultureamp.design/guides/animation/) when badge numbers increase.

### When not to use?

*   If you need a text label, use [tags](https://drive.google.com/a/cultureamp.com/open?id=1k0l1XoRvI00ofdAcYYyugYKyFdeJz-9fUdWlVcOwR4o) instead
