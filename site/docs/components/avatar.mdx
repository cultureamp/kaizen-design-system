## Visuals

### UI Kit

<iframe style="border: none;" width="744" height="450" src="https://www.figma.com/embed?embed_host=share&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.figma.com%2Ffile%2Fe3TyAOZKfLg9cA01Iy1Mgm%2FKaizen-Site-embed%3Fnode-id%3D17270%253A114" allowfullscreen></iframe>

## To keep in mind

- Where possible, link the avatar to details about the individual or group it represents:
  - Where appropriate, link the avatar to a context-specific view of that individual or group. Otherwise, link to their canonical "profile" page.
  - Don't link the avatar while it's shown on the individual's canonical "profile" page.
- When there is no image to show, use initials:
  - For a single name, use the first letter only, capitalized. For 2 names, use the initial letter of both names, capitalized. For 3 or more names, use the initial letter of the first and last name, capitalized.
  - When the name is known, use "personal" initials. Otherwise, use "generic" initials.
- Use with name:
  - Provide a text label showing the individual or group's name near the avatar when it's the only place the name is shown.
  - Use an empty `alt=""`.
- Use without name:
  - You might skip showing the individual or group's name when the avatar is shown in a list and linked to a place where the name is shown.
  - For `alt` text, use their name.
- Loading:
  - If an image fails to load, fall back to initials.
