## To keep in mind

- Where possible, link the avatar to details about the individual or group it represents:
  - Where appropriate, link the avatar to a context-specific view of that individual or group. Otherwise, link to their canonical "profile" page.
  - Don't link the avatar while it's shown on the individual's canonical "profile" page.
- When there is no personal photo to show, use initials:
  - Because personal names differ around the world, consider avoiding using initials that may not represent an individual accurately. You might show their full name instead.
  - We tend to use the first letter of each space-separated word for initials and capitalize them. You may need to resize the initials text for more than 4 names.
  - For the current user, show the personal avatar using the personal background color. That is, use the personal avatar color for "you".
  - For all other users in a page, show the generic avatar using the generic background color. That is, use the generic avatar color for "everyone else".
- When there is no specific individual or group identified, use the default user avatar.
  - For example, if you were previewing a 360 survey template with no specific user assigned, you might show a default user avatar.
- Use with name:
  - Provide a text label showing the individual or group's name near the avatar when it's the only place the name is shown.
  - Use an empty `alt=""`.
- Use without name:
  - You might skip showing the individual or group's name when the avatar is shown in a list and linked to a place where the name is shown.
  - For `alt` text, use their name.
- Loading:
  - If an image fails to load, fall back to the default user avatar.
