Transactional emails are usually sent from the platform to alert users about changes to their permissions/capabilities, to remind users to take a survey, or to inform users that an auto-upload has completed. Currently, we have both uneditable emails with standard copy, and editable emails that can be personalized by our users.

To write transactional emails, keep these points in mind:


*   **Focus on the action.** Prioritize the main thing you want the reader to take away. Make this the focus of your email.
*   **Prioritize the reader.** Don’t tell them, “we’ve done this.” Tell them, “now you can do this.”
*   **Don’t forget the Academy.** Avoid providing advice or instructions in the email itself. Instead, create a piece of Academy content to which you can link from the email.
*   **Keep it short.** Stick to your point and use active voice.
*   **Make it read naturally.** Do everything you can to reduce formality, reduce the reading level of your text. If you’re having trouble doing that, paste it sentence by sentence into the [text analysis tool](https://www.webpagefx.com/tools/read-able/) (or use Hemingway) so you can identify and improve the specific ones that are problematic.
*   **Avoid tech speak.** Try to avoid using jargon and industry terms that are unfamiliar outside of our industry. This also applies to words that could get caught up in spam filters, for example ‘please’, ‘purchase’, ‘now’, etc.
*   **Check it twice.** Proofread and then show your system emails to a content strategist, ideally before you make them live.
