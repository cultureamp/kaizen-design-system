### General styles


#### Active voice vs. passive voice

There are two kinds of construction in English: active and passive. We use active voice at Culture Amp. Not only does it help to simplify sentences, it can also help you shorten your writing and make it less convoluted.

Active sentences have an actor, an action, and a thing that receives the action. Here’s a simple example:

>The cat (actor) sat (action) on the mat (thing receiving the action).

Passive sentences demote the actor (or remove them entirely) to prioritize either the action, or the thing that’s receiving action. For example:

>The mat (thing receiving the action) was sat on (action) \[by the cat](actor).

Let’s take a look at another example that’s in passive voice:

>The employee survey was taken by over 400 employees at the company.

To fix it, we can rearrange the sentence so that the actor (400 employees) comes before the action and the thing receiving the action: 

>Over 400 employees at the company took the employee survey.

Words like “was” and “by” may indicate that you’re writing in passive voice, though not always. Scan for these words and rework sentences where they appear.

Distinguishing between active and passive can often be very confusing, so make sure you ask a content strategist if you’re in doubt.


#### American spelling

We use American spelling across the Culture Amp platform including in transactional emails, Intercom messages and the Academy. There are a few exceptions, but those mostly apply to marketing communications in different regions and personal communications to customers/users. Here are some common misspellings that apply to our platform:



*   Organization (not organisation)
*   Analyze (not analyse)
*   Favor (not favour)
*   Color (not colour)
*   Enterprise (not enterprize)
*   Favorite (not favourite)
*   Enroll (not enrol)
*   Behavior (not behaviour)

Set the autocorrect and spell check functions of your laptop to US English in your design and writing apps. If you’re unsure of which spelling to use for what you’re writing, ask a content writer at Culture Amp. You can also consult [Merriam Webster](https://www.merriam-webster.com/ ) (the first spelling displayed on the site is the dominant American English form) or [Lexico](https://www.lexico.com/grammar/british-and-spelling) to further understand regionalization of words.


#### Ampersand (&)

An ampersand is included in some product feature names, and must be included in them every time, in every instance.

Otherwise, don’t use ampersands in sentences, nor in titles or labels or other text.


#### Bold text

As a general rule, we don’t use bold text for emphasis or to draw a user’s attention. If you think you need to make a particular word or phrase bold in your writing, consider rephrasing your sentence to highlight the part you want to draw attention to. For example:

>Do: Our inspirations help you take effective action on your survey results.
>
>Don’t: You can take action on your survey results using **inspirations.**


#### Capitalization

We use various forms of capitalization at Culture Amp. Here are the common use cases:



*   Sentence case - Use sentence case, not title case, across the board both in the platform and outside. This means that the first letter of your sentence should be capitalized leaving everything else in lower case (unless there’s a proper noun or product feature name). For example:

>Do: How to use the product language guide to write better copy
>
>Don’t: How To Use The Product Language Guide To Write Better Copy 



*   Culture Amp terms - Capitalize all Culture Amp specific terms (such as brand names). For example, People Geek, Culture First, Geekup, Camp, Camper, Camperversary, etc. If you’re unsure of which terms we capitalize, consult the glossary.
*   Proper nouns - Capitalize all proper nouns such as countries, cities and people.
*   Product features - Capitalize the names of all product features. To make it easy, here’s a handy list for what should and shouldn’t be capitalized in the platform:

<table>
  <tr>
   <td>
Capitalized
   </td>
   <td>Not capitalized
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>
<ul>

<li>Turnover calculator</li>

<li>Group spotlight</li>

<li>Manager dashboard</li>

<li>Company dashboard</li>

<li>Academy</li>

<li>Manager learning</li>

<li>People scientist</li>


</ul>
   </td>
   <td>
<ul>

<li>manager</li>

<li>inspiration</li>

<li>demographic</li>

<li>goals</li>

<li>report</li>

<li>engagement</li>

<li>performance</li>

<li>onboarding survey</li>
</ul>
   </td>
  </tr>
</table>


Avoid unnecessary capitalization like using initial capitals on words you want to emphasize, or feel are important.


#### Dates

When writing dates, spell out the day of the week and abbreviate the month.

>Do: Thursday, Aug 26, 2020
>
>Don’t: Thu, August 26, 2020

In some parts of the world, the month comes first, in other parts the day. For example, it’s hard to tell whether 6/12/2017 refers to June 6th, 2017 or Dec 6th 2017. So, typing out the name of the month as opposed to the number helps remove ambiguity and caters to a wider audience.

When you’re only referring to a month or month/year, spell out the name of the month. For example:

>Do: August 26 or August 2020
>
>Don’t: Aug 26th 

Do not use ordinal indicators (as seen in superscripts) like “th,” “nd,” or “st.”

For convenience dates, mention the number of days if it’s less than a week. For example, “Due in 5 days.” If it’s more than a week, round it down to a week. Alternatively, you can also mention the date, “Due on March 26, 2020.”


#### e.g.

e.g. is an abbreviation of the latin phrase _exempli gratia_ meaning “for the sake of example.” We recommend against using it in the platform. Instead use “for example” or “like.” 


> Do: You can splice your results using demographics, for example, age, gender and geography.
>
>Don’t: You can splice your results using demographics, e.g. age, gender, geography, etc.


#### Gender

Avoid using gendered language like “he” or “she.” Instead use words like “they,” “them,” “people,”  “the person,” “the employee,” or “HR leader.” 

For more, see personal pronouns.


#### Headings and titles

Remember to write all headings and titles in sentence case, that is the first word of the sentence should be capitalized leaving everything lower case (unless there’s a proper noun or brand name). You don’t have to place a period at the end of a title or heading. For example:

>Do: The Culture Amp language style guide
>
>Don’t: The Culture Amp Language Style Guide


#### Links

Links are used commonly across Culture Amp to connect the reader to the Academy, support and other features within the platform. When inserting a hyperlink, make sure the text that’s being linked communicates information related to the link. Don’t use ‘click here’ or ‘learn more’ as links or button labels. They’re ambiguous and create uncertainty about where those links lead. Plus, they’re not good for accessibility or scanning. Instead, use text that describes where they’ll go or what they’ll do and try to include the link at the end of your sentence after the objective.

>Do: “Find out more about our <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Employee Data Import Wizard</span>.”
>
>Don’t: “Learn more about our Employee Data Wizard <span style="text-decoration:underline;">here</span>.” 


>Do: “For additional help, contact <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Culture Amp support</span>.”  
>
>Don’t: “<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Click here</span> to contact Culture Amp support.”


#### Lists

Lists are a great way to break up huge chunks of text and make paragraphs more scannable. We recommend using them when you can, but make sure you standardize the grammatical structure.

If the items in your list are one sentence each, begin with a capital altter and leave the period off. For example:


>There are many ways a manager can improve their employee performance:
>
>*   Adopt a growth mindset
>*   Individualize your management style
>*   Give ongoing feedback

If the items in your list have more than one sentence, include full stops.

For a list that begins with an introduction or a “stem” sentence, make sure that each initial word is a follow on from that sentence. Give each point a lowercase initial. For example:


>In one click, you can:

>*   send reminders
>*   change due dates
>*   delete multiple 360 surveys


#### Numbers

There are various rules that apply to numbers in writing:



*   If you begin a sentence with a number, spell it out. For example, “Five ways to encourage your employees to take action”.
*   All numbers should be spelled out in numerals like 1, 6, 10, 78. Not one, six, ten and seventy eight. Numerals are easy to scan and read.
*   All numbers that have more than three digits should include a comma. For example, 1,300, 3,000, 28,000.
*   There are always exceptions to these rules, especially when it comes to readability. When in doubt, always ask!


#### Personal pronouns

Pronouns take the place of nouns in writing. We recommend the use of pronouns to make your writing more conversational and less robotic. Here are some commonly used pronouns and the rules that apply:



*   **You, yours** - This is the most commonly used pronoun across the platform and is a way to put the user in control. It helps create a direct dialogue and conveys clear directions when required. For example:

>Do: Invite your team members to give you feedback 
>
>Don’t: Invite a team member to provide feedback

>Do: You can now view your reports in the Reports tab
>
>Don’t: Reports can now be viewed in the Reports tab


>Do: Here are the actions you’ve created
>
>Don’t :These actions have been created

*   **We - ‘**We’ is used to refer to Culture Amp as an entity. This is reserved for when Culture Amp takes responsibility for something, or takes an action on behalf of the user.

>Do: We recommend you keep track of your progress.
>
>Don’t: It’s recommended that you keep track of your progress.


>Do: There was a problem loading your dashboard. We’re working on fixing it.
>
>Don’t: There was a problem loading your dashboard and it’s being fixed.


‘We’ doesn’t work when the platform (system) is responsible for the action and not us. 


>Do: This reporting group couldn’t be displayed
>
>Don’t: We couldn’t display this reporting group

>Do: The report doesn’t exist
>
>Don’t: We couldn’t find your report

*   **I** - This is reserved for when users need to take ownership or agency.

>Do: I agree to the terms and conditions
>
>Don’t: You should agree to the terms and conditions


**Pronouns in UI text**

When we write copy for the UI, it’s generally in second person as it’s the system talking to the user. Never assume the user’s point of view and avoid pronouns like ‘I’ and ‘my’ (except for legal examples like the above).

>Do: Your profile
>
>Don’t: My profile

>Do: Your action plans
>
>Don’t: My action plans

To save space and be concise, you can remove the pronoun from buttons and links.

>Do: View reports
>
>Don’t: View your reports

>Do: Create goal
>
>Don’t: Create your goal


#### Times

When writing out a time, use the user’s local time without a time zone in all cases when it’s unambiguous. Use a.m. or p.m. and not 24-hour time. Here are some other rules to keep in mind:



*   Use spaces between the time and the meridiem a.m. or p.m. marker. For example, 8:30 a.m. or 7:00 p.m.
*   Use a colon to separate hours from minutes.
*   Use en dashes in a time range, e.g. 8:30 a.m.–9:45 a.m.
*   For time ranges in a sentence, use words to separate them: Automatically run sync between midnight and 3:00 a.m. (PDT)


#### Two words or one?

If you’re worried about whether words like log in, log out, sign in to and sign into are two words or one, they’re both.

Generally, we use “sign in” across the Culture Amp platform. Note that it’s “Sign in to Culture Amp” not “Sign into Culture Amp.” While we tend not to use “log in”, it’s best to keep in mind the rules around “log in” and “login.” The single word is used as a noun. The two-word version is used as a phrasal verb, to talk about the action. For example:

>To sign in to Culture Amp, you’ll need login details.

>You will need to log in to see your report.

Every day is two words unless you’re using it as an adjective: an everyday action.


### Punctuation


#### Apostrophes

Apostrophes are used to make a word possessive. For a singular possessive the apostrophe comes before the s. For example:

>The employee’s review.

>The company’s leaders were happy with the survey results.

If the word is singular but ends in an s, add an ‘s to the end. For example:

>The syllabus’s components consist of three parts.

>Our People Scientist Chris’s love for benchmarks is awesome.

For a plural possessive, it comes after the s. For example: 

>The employees’ change rooms.

>The companies’ leaders were happy with the survey results.

For plurals that don’t end in an ‘s’, the apostrophe goes before the s: women’s, children’s.

Don’t use apostrophes to make numbers or acronyms into plurals. For example:

>Do: APIs are available
>Don’t: API’s are available

>Do: Since the 1950s
>Don’t: Since the 1950’s


#### Colons and semicolons

Colons are used to introduce a list. For example:

> Your employees match the following demographics: age, gender and tenure.

Colons can also be used to join two related sentences together, especially in titles. For example:

> How to use the Action Framework to your advantage: A Culture Amp guide

Colons also separate hours from minutes when we’re talking about time.

Semicolons are usually used in long sentences. This can get complicated, so avoid them if you can. An easy way to get the same result is to break your sentences up into two lines, or use an en dash.


#### Commas

Commas are used to separate words and word groups. The most common way to use a comma is when you’re listing items in a sentence or introducing a list. For example:

> We filtered our survey results by gender, age, geography and tenure.

Pro tip: Read your sentence out loud. Put a comma where you find yourself pausing for half a second or wherever you take a breath.

Commas are also used to separate a sentence that has a dependent clause. For example:

>If you encounter this problem again, please contact Culture Amp support.

A serial comma, commonly referred to as the Oxford comma, is the final comma used in a list. For example:

> We filtered our survey results by gender, age, geography, and tenure.

As we follow the AP style guide, we recommend against using this type of comma.

For other use cases, take a look at the AP style guidelines. 


#### Dashes

Dashes are used to separate parts of sentences. Remember, these are different from a hyphen. There are broadly two types of dashes used in writing:



*   The en dash (Mac shortcut: option + minus key) is used to separate a span of numbers, times or dates. For example, 9–12, 2010–2020. No spaces are used on either side of the en dash.
*   The em dash (Mac shortcut: shift + option + minus key) is used in place of commas to break up sentences. For example:

>After running an engagement survey—nearly two quarters after their last—they saw significant changes in their results.


As the overuse of this type of dash can get clunky, we advise against using it. When in doubt, use a comma instead, or break up your sentence into two.



#### Ellipses

An ellipses is a special punctuation mark consisting of three dots (not just three fullstops). Its shortcut on a Mac is option + ; or ctrl + alt + . on a PC. The ellipses serves a number of different purposes:



*   It can be used on labels and buttons to indicate the action will not happen immediately because more information is required.
*   It prepares users to expect a screen or modal to make selections or enter more information.

Avoid using ellipses for purposes other than the above. They wear thin quickly.


#### Exclamation marks

Exclamation marks are used to add strong feelings, emphasis or a high volume of speaking. Use these sparingly and never use more than one as they can become annoying. If you’re unsure about whether to add an exclamation point or not, err on the side of no. Instead, use well-chosen words to convey excitement or emphasis. When in doubt, ask a content strategist.


#### Oxford commas

See commas.


#### Slashes

The slash is a versatile punctuation mark that’s often used as a stand-in for the words “per” or “or.” For every case, we advise against using the slash. When in doubt, use “per” or “or.” The only time slashes are acceptable are in URLs, for example:

>cultureamp.com/event/webinars. 

Make sure you don’t confuse the forward slash (/) with a backward slash (\).


#### Stops or periods

Full stops or periods are widely used to conclude to a sentence. They’re also used between e.g., p.m., and a.m., and after contractions like Ms., vs. and etc. They’re not used for capitalized abbreviations like EST, PDT, or NA.

In the UI, only use periods when you’ve got two or more sentences. For one sentence, you don’t need a period. Avoid using periods at the end of titles or subtitles.
