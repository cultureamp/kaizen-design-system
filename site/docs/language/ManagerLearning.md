Manager Learning is dedicated to helping users find quick answers, expert ideas and tools for being a great manager. It’s a space designed for continual learning and is accessible through the platform once logged in. 

The content will always be People Science-led and include content from our trusted partners. Content forms will be Culture Amp and partner produced written instructional pieces (taken from our action ideas and inspirations), videos, fact sheets and illustrations. 

When you’re writing:



*   Write step-by-step, numbered instructions.
*   Write in short sentences and paragraphs.
*   Use lists to present alternatives or options within a step.
*   Commission an illustration, use video or fact sheet, if the information or tool is better conveyed this way. 
*   Be clear on whether the content piece is for the manager or their team, and highlight as such for ‘You’ or ‘Your team’.
*   Level tag: label each piece of content for a beginner manager or experienced manager: foundation, advanced
*   Effort tag: consider the effort level or complexity of the task: low, medium, high
*   Time tag: give an approx. time to complete the task: 15 min, 1 hour, 1 day, 1+ day
*   Activity tag: consider if the task is for the manager or their team: you, your team.
*   If you add links be sure to include them in the body of the text, we don’t use ‘see this link’ instead we say “To build effective cultures, try <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Dr Rose Amber’s view</span> which includes…”


## **Writing considerations for each part of the Manager Learning**

   <td>1-2 sentences on why this skill is important to a Manager
   </td>
   <td>Coaching happens when a manager asks questions rather than offering advice or direction. Take this approach to grow your team member by listening, asking effective questions, empathizing, summarizing, reflecting, unlocking limiting beliefs and being open-minded.

## **Writing process**



*   **Think about the manager’s mindset.** How do they feel when they reach this piece of help content? Consider their stresses, frustrations, and desires in this moment.
*   **Identify their goal within Manager Learning.** What does the manager want to achieve when they land on this page? Play close attention to the titles of your content and align them with the specific goals of the reader. Make sure you pay close attention to the voice and tone of writing.
*   **Tighten up the text.** Shorten or break up sentences wherever you can. Use the rules outlined in the grammar and punctuation portion of this guide.
*   **Make it read naturally.** Do everything you can to reduce formality, reduce the reading level of your text. If you’re having trouble doing that, paste it sentence by sentence into the [text analysis tool](https://www.webpagefx.com/tools/read-able/) (or use Hemingway) so you can identify and improve the specific ones that are problematic.
*   **Check it twice.** Proofread the message, then have a writer check it.
