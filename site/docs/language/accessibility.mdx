The Culture Amp platform caters to a wide range of users with differing mental and physical abilities. As we move towards making copy across the product more accessible, it’s important to keep in mind that writing for accessibility is more than just ensuring that the text is easy to read. Here are some basic rules:


*   **Think about your page and content structure**. Screen readers traditionally read from left to right and from top to bottom. Make sure you structure your content on the page keeping that in mind. When it comes to tables, keep them simple and ensure that each column has a heading that can be easily read.
*   **Don’t rely solely on images.** Images are a great way to enhance your design, but they’re not helpful to people who are visually impaired. Don’t rely on the image to get your message across. Include alt copy that describes what you’re asking the user to take away from that page.
*   **Watch your links.** Avoid hyperlinking language like “click here” as it won’t indicate where the user should go.
*   **Pay close attention to your empty states and error messages.** When a user encounters these components in the platform, make sure that they can perform an action based on it. Saying “error 404” is just as frustrating to someone who is visually impaired as it is to someone who isn’t.
*   **Be descriptive.** There’s a difference between being descriptive and overburdening your design with copy. Make sure that every word counts and guides users towards achieving a goal.
*   **Use descriptive labels in forms.** Instead of placeholder text, use descriptive labels and helper text where needed to provide further guidance to the users. Relying solely on placeholder text tends to make forms [less accessible](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/form-design-placeholders/).
*   **Be simple.** Use plan language that everyone can understand. Leave the academic writing and jargon at the door.
