Culture Amp has very specific and strict policies around privacy, copyright and terms of use. The copy for these is written by our legal team. If you’re considering writing any legal content, we strongly recommend you run it by your local legal team first to ensure they give you the okay from a legality perspective. After this, check the content to make sure that our users can understand the message you’re trying to get across.

In general, we try to keep our legal content pleasant and friendly without losing any precision. Keep the following in mind:



*   **Be clear.** Leave legal jargon and industry terms at the door. Write with clarity using words that any user can understand. Read it out loud. If it sounds academic, it probably is.
*   **Use definitions.** If there’s a legal term that has no simple alternative, define the word first before you use it across your writing.
*   **Use contractions.** Contractions make your writing more friendly. 
*   **Ask a content strategist.** Legal content can confound the best of writers. If you’re in doubt, have a content strategist take a look at it.
