Intercom messages are messages that pop up while users are using Culture Amp. They’re used to inform users of new features, system outages, service updates, platform changes and to ask users for feedback. They’re a great marketing tool and help give the product a more human voice.

Keep these points in mind if you need to write an Intercom message:


*   **Focus on the action.** Prioritize the main thing you want the reader to take away. Make this the focus of your email.
*   **Keep it short.** Stick to your point and use active voice.
*   **Make it visual.** Include a small image if you need to highlight a change to the interface.
*   **Prioritize the reader.** Don’t tell them, “we’ve done this.” Tell them, “now you can do this.”
*   **Make it read naturally.** Do everything you can to reduce formality, reduce the reading level of your text. If you’re having trouble doing that, paste it sentence by sentence into the [text analysis tool](https://www.webpagefx.com/tools/read-able/) (or use Hemingway) so you can identify and improve the specific ones that are problematic.
*   **Ask a content strategist.** Have a content strategist read over the text for tone before you make it live.
