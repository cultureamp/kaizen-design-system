Culture Amp currently uses Smartling to translate the platform to over 40 languages. Localization can often become a tricky issue as every language uses its own unique set of rules, punctuation, conjugation and tense. 

To make sure we set our translators up for an easier translation process, there are some basic points we need to keep in mind:



*   **Watch your colloquialisms and metaphors** – many of these don’t not always translate well in another language. This is also true for different English dialects. For example, “easy as” is something we’d hear in New Zealand, but not necessarily in the US.
*   **Watch your “ing” words**. Not only do “ing” words or “gerunds” tend to make your writing clunky, they’re also difficult to translate. For example, say “Design a survey easily with our survey designer” instead of “Designing a survey is easy with our survey designer.”
*   **Sentence length.** Make sure you limit your sentences to 20 words or less. While a sentence in English may have 30 words, the same sentence could take up 40 words in another language.
*   **Voice and tone.** Our tone at Culture Amp is friendly but not overly familiar. Follow it and stick to it. This is the trickiest part of writing and a content strategist is always available to help you out.
*   **Use active voice.** As a general rule, we use active voice across the platform. This also has a huge impact on how easy it is to translate what we’ve got.
*   **Be clear.** Make sure all your sentences get across your points clearly and simply without getting convoluted. Don’t bury the point you’re trying to make.
*   **Be mindful of words that have a double meaning.** For example, the word “right” could mean politically right leaning, correct, a direction. See if you can find an alternative, or structure your sentence to ensure clarity on the intended meaning of the word.
*   **Refer to the glossary.** Our glossary of terms is full of definitions for commonly used words across Culture Amp. It’s also a great place to check or reference spelling and capitalization.
