At Culture Amp, we write a lot of technical content for the Academy. This content helps users navigate the platform, configure settings, design surveys and get updates on what’s new in the product. In other words, every article is a tool to help someone use the product to achieve a goal.

When you’re writing technical content:



*   Use the rules outlined in the grammar and punctuation portion of this guide.
*   Write step-by-step, numbered instructions.
*   Write in short sentences and paragraphs that are easily scannable.
*   Use images wherever they logically make sense.
*   Don’t forget to [maintain your articles in the Academy](https://academy.cultureamp.com/hc/en-us/articles/205062809-Using-Academy-maintaining-articles) over time.
*   Make sure you proofread and post in the #feedback_academy channel on Slack if you want your work edited or sense checked.


### The writing process



*   **Think about the user.** How do they feel when they reach this piece of help content? Consider their stresses, frustrations and desires in this moment.
*   **Identify their goal within the product.** Define what the user wants to do in around five words. Shape this into a title for your help article.
*   **Map the process.** Give the user a series of numbered steps to get to their end goal. Use a note to highlight information which is not a direct part of the process of achieving the user’s goal, but will help them complete that process.
*   **Make it read naturally.** Do everything you can to reduce formality, reduce the reading level of your text. If you’re having trouble doing that, paste it sentence by sentence into the [text analysis tool](https://www.webpagefx.com/tools/read-able/) (or use Hemingway) so you can identify and improve the specific ones that are problematic.
