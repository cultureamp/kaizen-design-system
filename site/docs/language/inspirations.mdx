Inspirations are suggestions and ideas on how to act on focus areas. They help improve scores for survey questions that are part of Culture Amp’s survey templates. We currently have hundreds of inspirations that are written by Campers, People Scientists, partners, thought leaders, coaches and HR specialists. 

Our inspirations currently have the following parts:



*   **Name/ Title of Inspiration:** This must be 3-5 words (44 characters max) and should grab the attention of the reader.
*   **Headline/ Excerpt:** This must be 5-10 words (78 characters max) and should succinctly explain the basic idea of the inspiration.
*   **Body :** The body consists of three main components – an intro, a why (how this is useful to the reader) and the instructions (step-by-step points on how to easily implement the inspirations). Keep it to 600–800 words. The body can include the following; further explanation or theory, context, action steps, timeline to see a result, potential outcome and if any guidance from others (e.g. Manager/ HR) and links to any resources and/ or models and diagrams for frameworks. 

Here are some basic rules to keep in mind when writing inspirations:



*   **Stick to the guide.** Make sure you follow all grammar and mechanics rules outlined in this language guide.
*   **Use a verb**. Start each inspiration with a verb (e.g. try, start, implement, introduce) to encourage users to take action.
*   **Don’t forget the details.** If an Inspiration is targeted at a company level but you also want to show how it would be done for individual teams, add a blank row and then 1-2 sentences that start with “Team Level: ...”
*   **Watch your links.** When placing a hyperlink into your copy include it as part of a sentence. Avoid ‘click here’ or click-bait language. Do not link to lead generation forms on your website or gated content.
