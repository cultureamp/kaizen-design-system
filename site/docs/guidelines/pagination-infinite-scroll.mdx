## To keep in mind

[Pagination](/components/pagination) can reduce results in large data sets down to easy-to-digest chunks. Each page has a link that can be bookmarked. The First, Current, and Last pages are always accessible, while other page links may be truncated when thereâ€™s too many to show at once. Pagination also has Previous and Next links.

Traditionally, Infinite Scroll loads and presents more results as you scroll without interruption, in a single stream. To minimize some drawbacks of this, however, we use a "View more" [Button](/components/button) that a user must click to progressively disclose only as much content as they want.

- Use [Pagination](/components/pagination) when people are unlikely to need to see **all** the content.
- Use [Pagination](/components/pagination) when the first page is enough to make a decision.
- Use [Pagination](/components/pagination) when loading all the content at once would not be possible technically or not be performant. If it takes more than 10 seconds to load all the content, paginate.
- Use [Pagination](/components/pagination) when keeping your place is important or you want to bookmark a specific page.
- Use [Pagination](/components/pagination) when there's lot of screen real estate.
- Consider using [Pagination](/components/pagination) when a list contains more than 50 items of a single line of text each.
- Use [Infinite Scroll](/components/infinite-scroll) with a "View more" button when someone may want to see every item and compare them at the same time.
- Use [Infinite Scroll](/components/infinite-scroll) with a "View more" button when we want and expect people to read more than 1 page worth of content without disrupting the experience with a page load.
- Use [Infinite Scroll](/components/infinite-scroll) with a "View more" button on small, touch devices if it feels more efficient to the user than pagination.
