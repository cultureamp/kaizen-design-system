## To keep in mind

**Alignment** creates visual connections, a sense of order, and hierarchy. It improves readability.

**Horizontal rhythm** keeps horizontal spaces between elements on a page consistent. In typography, horizontal rhythm impacts legibility.

**Optical alignment** in design refers to how we adjust UI for what “looks right” versus real measurements:

> “Our eyes are weird organs that often tell lies to us. But if you know the peculiarities of human vision, you can construct more approachable and clean designs. Not only do type designers utilize optical tricks for creating readable and well-balanced fonts, but it’s also helpful for interface designers, who build user-computer interaction.”

* You can use Grid Units such as 12px (½ Grid Unit) or 24px (1 Grid Unit) for alignment.
* **Optical adjustments**: 
    * Sometimes, 10px increments are more appropriate to keep related elements closer together. Minor adjustments made as needed don’t need to follow grid units or use variables. Some optical adjustments might be just 1px or 2px. 
    * If the same adjustments are made repeatedly, that might be an opportunity for an improvement in the system.
