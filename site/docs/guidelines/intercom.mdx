## To keep in mind

The Intercom icon can be used in these situations:

- Allowing users to quickly access help (e.g. through contacting the support team or accessing the academy)
- Sending targeted messages to users (e.g. to start conversations with users or to provide product updates)

### Position

- The Intercom icon should appear in the same position across the product (at the bottom right corner of the screen).
- As it is a fixed element, it should not block anything on the page behind it.

### Styling

- The styling of the Intercom icon is done in the Intercom product 
- Recommendations on how to style a custom Intercom icon:
    - Your icon must be smaller than 50 kB.
    - The optimum image size is 72px x 72px.
    - A PNG or GIF with a transparent background works best, if using an image with a colored background, set the “Action color” in your Messenger settings to match. 


## When to use and when not to use

If in doubt, have a conversation with the Design Systems advocates or the design practice. If you feel strongly, talk about that.
