- **Global notification:** A global notification is always at the top of the screen and stretches the full width of the viewport. It is used for system-level notifications that inform the user about system status such as logging in and background processes like data imports.
 
- **Inline notification:** Inline notifications appear within content areas as close as possible to the thing that it’s about. It is used for contextual information.

- **Toast notification:** Toasts appear in the top–right (or top–left in right-to-left languages). It is used immediately after a specific event such as a user action that does not relate to an object on the page. For example, confirmation of deleted items.
