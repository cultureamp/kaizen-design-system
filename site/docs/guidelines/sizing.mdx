needToKnow:
  - 'Use "Small", "Medium", "Large" and, in code, use `sm`, `md`, `lg`.'
  - "For additional sizing options: in code, use `xxs`, `xs`, `sm`, `md`, `lg`, `xl`, `xxl`."

## To keep in mind

- We use 3 primary Sizing options for most components: "Small", "Medium", "Large". 
  - In code, `sm`, `md`, `lg`.
  - Some components only need 2 sizes, e.g. “Small” and “Medium”.
  - If a component has only one size, we refer to it by its name or “default”.
- For additional sizing options, if absolutely necessary, you can use these 7 options: "Extra Extra Small", "Extra Small", "Small", "Medium", "Large", "Extra Large", and "Extra Extra Large". 
  - In code, `xxs`, `xs`, `sm`, `md`, `lg`, `xl`, and `xxl`.
- A component sizing option doesn’t mean it is necessarily fixed width or fluid width.
- In some cases, we don’t specify a “size” but rather a minimum and maximum width and let the content determine what exact width is appropriate. For example, our modals have min and max widths instead of sizes.
- For some components, the page, context, and content will likely dictate where breakpoints make sense. For example, a data table would vary depending on what data is present.

## When to use

- When the component has a particular layout at a particular size.
- Use this component sizing with fixed width or fluid width components.
- Let containers decide the exact size.

## When not to use

- For describing specific content such as body, heading, image, use those words instead of sizes (that is, don’t use “tall” to describe a heading when you could use “heading” or “square” to describe an image when you could use “image”)
