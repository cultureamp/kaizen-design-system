title: Vertical Rhythm and Baseline Grid
navTitle: Vertical Rhythm and Baseline Grid
summaryParagraph: |
  Vertical rhythm keeps vertical spaces between elements on a page consistent. The baseline is the invisible line upon which a line of text rests. The baseline grid is used to achieve vertical rhythm.
tags: ['Grid']
needToKnow:
  - "Use Grid Units. Culture Amp’s Grid Unit is 24px. E.g. “margin: $ca-grid;”"
  - "As a general rule, we use 12px (½ Grid Unit) or 24px (1 Grid Unit) for vertical rhythm."
  - "Our baseline shift approach we had in place to align text to a baseline grid has been deprecated - see below for details."

## To keep in mind

Vertical rhythm relates elements together through proximity and create an aesthetically pleasing appearance. In [typography](/guidelines/typography/), vertical rhythm impacts the readability of the text and establishes visual hierarchy.

In order for visual rhythm to work, not only do elements have to take up the same amount of space on the grid, but the text within those elements needs to have the baseline sit at the same place on the grid line. Our UI Kit is designed with this in mind. (See “Bad Rhythm” below for an example of why consistently sized elements that do not have a baseline shift is insufficient)

* 1 Grid Unit is 24px. This is intended primarily to achieve vertical rhythm but is also used for [horizontal rhythm](/guidelines/alignment).
    * Note: 1 Grid Unit is implemented in code as 1.5rem so that type adjusts to people’s browser font size settings.
* As a general rule, use 12px (½ Grid Unit) or 24px (1 Grid Unit) to separate elements within a container.

## Code implementation & usage details

* We previously used the [Basekick/baseline shift approach](https://github.com/michaeltaranto/basekick) but abandoned it because of the complexities it caused in implementation. Consumers often needed to be aware of what Basekick was and how it worked if they needed to make seemingly minute alterations. Now that Figma accounts for line height in a similar way to what the web does we've deprecated baseline shift. If you'd like to read more about what baseline shift was trying to solve, see [this Figma article](https://www.figma.com/blog/line-height-changes/).

## When to use and when not to use

<WhenToUseAndWhenNotToUse>
<WhenToUse>

- To control positioning of elements close together inside a container.

</WhenToUse>
<WhenNotToUse>

- There's no need to use any new instances of baseline shift as this approach is deprecated.
