- **Badge:** Badges show the count of some adjacent data. A dot badge notifies the user that something is new or updated without showing a count. For numerical counts, use a badge.

- **Tag:** Tags visually label items with small amounts of information or the itemâ€™s status, usually with keywords that help organize and categorize the items. They may be persistent or dismissable. Dismissable tags can be added or removed by users. If you need a text label, use tags.
