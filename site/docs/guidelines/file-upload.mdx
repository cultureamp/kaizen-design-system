## To keep in mind

### File picker

A file picker lets people browse files from device storage to choose a file or files to upload them to our products.

- Provide a form `label` and an `input type="file"`, which looks like a button, to browse files from device storage.

### Drag and drop

A drag-and-drop file upload lets people drag a file or files from their device to an area of the interface (a "drop zone") to upload them to our products.

- Drop zone style:
    - Provide a visual cue, such as a [Well](/components/well) with a dashed border style, to show what part of the page is the drop zone.
    - Before dragging, highlight the drop zone with a clear, obvious border or outline.
    - While dragging, emphasize the drop zone even further for a strong affordance that dropping is possible in that area.
- Where possible, make the whole window the drop target on hover so there's a large drop target that demands minimal coordination.
- Offer a file picker as well as drag and drop.
- Consider the risks of multiple drop zones on one page.

### Progress

- Show progress for the upload itself while the file is uploading:
    - Where possible, show remaining time to upload the file or files using a progress bar. If it is a short, unknown time, consider using a [Loading Spinner](/components-loading-spinner).
- Show progress for processing and other handling of files, such as validating content in a CSV:
    - Process an uploaded file sometimes takes longer than uploading. You might consider showing a single progress bar for both the upload and processing step. You might also consider using a Workflow to show progress across multiple steps.

### Errors

- Consider how to handle these common file upload errors both technically and in terms of experience:
    - Large files (e.g. prevent uploading files over 10MB).
    - Retry or resume the upload if it fails part way through (e.g. if there's a flakey network connection, automatically retry and let the user know).
    - Format limitations (e.g. limit image uploads to only JPG and PNG, and prohibit SVGs to avoid risks of JavaScript in SVGs).
    - Dimension limitations (e.g. reject images over 10000px wide or high).

### File types

- Consider what kinds of files to handle:
    - Images (e.g. company logos and personal avatars that need crop and preview).
    - Spreadsheets in various formats, such as CSVs, XLSs, and `.numbers`.
    - You might need to provide an error state to reject files provided in other formats.
    - You might need to provide microcopy upfront to indicate what file formats are accepted.

### Image uploads

- Image `alt` text:
    - Consider if the user needs to provide `alt` text with the uploaded image or if it's appropriate to provide an auto-generated `alt` text, such as the company name for a company logo.
- Consider letting people crop their images or provide default cropping, such as circle clipping/cropping for avatars.
- Consider showing people a preview of their image before saving it.
    - People might be able to start manipulating (e.g. cropping) the image without waiting for full upload in modern browsers.
- Consider letting people position the image within a frame (e.g. positioning a rectangular image within a circle for an avatar).

### Handle paste events

- In a textarea, you might let people paste images from their clipboard as well as drag and drop files to that textarea.

### Other considerations

- Consider if you need to support and handle multi-file uploads.
- Consider if file export needs to be supported.
- Consider providing a template file.

## When to use and when not to use

<WhenToUseAndWhenNotToUse>
<WhenToUse>

- We can sometimes avoid building features for manipulating files in our products when people can export and import files to manipulate them outside of the platform, especially tabular data.

</WhenToUse>
<WhenNotToUse>

- Drag and drop is often more complex than a file picker, so you might offer only a file picker for infrequently used features.
