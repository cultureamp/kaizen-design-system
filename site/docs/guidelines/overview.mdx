## To keep in mind

These guidelines help foster shared language for designers and front-end engineers.

Unlike components, guidelines don't contain reusable code. They sometimes describe how to find and use shared, reusable code, such as design tokens and templates.



## When to use

If in doubt, have a conversation with the Design Systems Team or the design practice. If you feel strongly, talk about that.

- Follow these guidelines when the behavior of an element you're designing is identical to an existing behavior.
- Follow these guidelines when an inconsistent approach from the design system is conspicuous and could cause users to ask "why" something looks different in one place to another. This might even be the best approach when elements behave similarly but not identically.



## When not to use

If in doubt, have a conversation with the Design Systems Team or the design practice. If you feel strongly, talk about that.

- When consistency with the design system's guidelines would make an interface less predictable, break away and let the Design Systems Team know.
- When consistency with the system would be detrimental to the experience, break away and let the Design Systems Team know.
- When behavior is different, elements should look different. When designing a new element, let the Design Systems Team know.
