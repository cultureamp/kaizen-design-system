*   Is it a link or a button?
    *   **Links navigate** somewhere and **can be opened in a new tab.** They have a **destination that can be bookmarked.**
    *   **Buttons perform actions**. If a “link” cannot be opened in a new tab, use a **button** instead.
*   **Secondary Action Buttons** kind of **look like links** but have lots of padding, a large clickable area, and sit next to other buttons, such as a Primary button. These are button elements and behave as buttons. That is, they perform actions and do not navigate.
*   If it behaves like a button it needs to look like a button:
    *   UI design that includes a link that has an action should consider if it’s absolutely necessary to be styled as a link. Ideally, it is a button.
    *   In exceptional circumstances, such as certain links that open modals, we may use a **link element** and give it **button behavior**:
        *   Give it a role of button i.e. role=”button”
        *   Give it an onclick function that prevents default link behavior
        *   For the href, give it a fragment identifier such as #modal
        *   Another approach we probably won’t use:
            *   Use a link element that actually navigates to the modal content hidden on the page and trigger a modal to open. This approach probably requires routing, and making it possible to navigate directly to the modal via a URL. This would only be possible for information modals, NOT confirmation modals that have actions such as confirmation of deleting an object on the page.
        *   Another approach we probably won’t use:
            *   Use a button element styled as a link. This is likely to be more pain than it’s worth, due to baseline grid adjustments, button padding, and more.
*   **Links that “open in a new tab” must use the “opens in new tab tooltip”**
*   **Cursors:**
    *   We settled on following the Operating System (OS) defaults:
        *   Links use pointer cursors that look like a hand pointing (“cursor: pointer”)
        *   Buttons have default cursors that look like an arrow (“cursor: default”)
    *   When Secondary Action Buttons are used as links, this can lead to a slightly confusing experience because the cursor changes. This can prompt a conversation about why we’re using a Secondary Action Buttons as link.
    *   One case for this approach:
        *   [Cursor pointer](http://kizu.ru/en/issues/cursor-pointer/)
    *   One case against this approach:
        *   [Buttons shouldn't have a hand cursor](https://adamsilver.io/articles/buttons-shouldnt-have-a-hand-cursor/)
        *   [Buttons shouldn't have a hand cursor: part 2](https://adamsilver.io/articles/buttons-shouldnt-have-a-hand-cursor-part-2/)
    *   Until we have strong user research evidence that this is a problem, we will stick with this.

## Opens in new tab tooltip

"Opens in a new tab" tooltip warns people that a link or button will open something in a new tab to avoid disrupting their workflow.

We rarely open links in new tabs. We **use a new tab only when necessary** when we want to avoid disorienting people. We use an "Opens in a new tab" tooltip every time we open something in a new tab to set expectations and minimize disorientation.

See this [InVision project](https://cultureamp.invisionapp.com/share/FXNQYLFUHSJ#/316728973_Index) that shows some alternative design treatments we considered. Our considerations include how to:

- accessibly let people know something will open in a new tab before interacting with it,
- be consistent across the platform,
- be flexible to different scenarios.

### When to use and when not to use

<WhenToUseAndWhenNotToUse>
<WhenToUse>

- You’re in the middle of a Workflow or Form where opening something in the current tab would result in data loss or lost progress.
- You’re currently playing media that would be interrupted.
- It’s a mailto: link that will open the user’s preferred mail client.

</WhenToUse>
<WhenNotToUse>

- Avoid "Opens in new tab" tooltip on a link to a PDF.
- Avoid "Opens in new tab" tooltip on an infinite-scrolling page.
- Avoid "Opens in new tab" tooltip on a link to an ‘external’ website.

</WhenNotToUse>
</WhenToUseAndWhenNotToUse>

### Keep in mind

* Tooltip text:
    * When a link or button will open something in a new tab, show a tooltip that says “Opens in a new tab”. If other info needs to appear in the tooltip, say “Verb noun (opens in a new tab)”, e.g. “Duplicate survey (opens in a new tab)”. Mostly, that action will be visible on the page already.

* In a **multi-step or long-running process** such as our employee data import wizard, it might be better to maintain state and let people navigate to a new link in the same tab and come back to the same place without losing their progress. 

* On an **infinite-scrolling page**, we can avoid using a link that opens in a new tab by making sure the “back” button remembers the state and keeps the user’s place in the scrolling stream of content.

* From a **modal**, we can avoid using a link that opens in a new tab by making sure the “back” button remembers the state and keeps the user’s place so returning to the page shows the open modal.

**If you’re not sure** how disruptive the link is, consider a call to action like “Open the survey preview page in a new tab to see what participants will see.”

In some cases, such as the survey designer’s “Preview” opening in a new tab, we might still want to show user’s a way to navigate forward through the app to return to the previous place, for example, the survey designer.

For [tooltips](/components/tooltip) in general, they must appropriately respond to changes in viewport and not get cut off at the edge of the screen or the edges of a modal. They must also be triggered on hover and (keyboard/touch) focus.

### Research Insights

We’ve seen customers frustrated about Academy articles NOT opening in a new tab and then being unable to navigate back to the app.
