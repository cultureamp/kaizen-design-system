## To keep in mind

Each layout pattern helps the user:

- identify the most important information
- identify the single next action they must perform
- understand how information on the page will be used
- efficiently understand and act on information

By using a limited selection of layout patterns, we create consistency in the platform and therefore clear expectations about where content and actions can be found or performed. This helps drive action.

Every layout has:

- Culture Amp branding that links back to “homepage”
  - Where ‘homepage’ means the home for that product e.g. cultureamp.cultureamp.com links to cultureamp.cultureamp.com, https://www.cultureamp.com/ links to https://www.cultureamp.com/
- Current page title that identifies where they are
- No more than 1 Primary Action Button
- Access to support such as the Help Center academy sidebar

Generally, most layout patterns have:

- A single task focus
- 1 prominent piece of information such as hero data
- Show where the user is relative to everything else
- Show where they can go next
- An emergency exit

Anatomy of core pages:

- Global nav (optional)
- Title block or Workflow header (mandatory)
- Side navigation (optional)
- Hero data (optional)
- Content area (mandatory)
- Workflow navigation (optional)

Key variables:

## Anatomy of page layouts

### Workflow bookends anatomy

An image belongs here…

- Intro: an introduction to a workflow that prepares the user for the task they are about to begin, giving them the info they need to be successful
- Outro: a successful end to a workflow that celebrates the key moment and prepares users for what happens next



### Workflow steps anatomy

- Workflow header: the workflow header is above the content area. It’s a full-width fluid section that stretches across the entire viewport. As you scroll, the header shrinks to maximize focus on the content area, but stays visible to provide context, easy access to primary actions such as “Preview” and easy access to emergency exits.

- E.g. Survey builder:
  - Survey overview page
  - Designer
  - Participants
  - Communications
  - Launch plan
