## Adding new icons

To add a new icon to the Kaizen UI Kit, to export an icon from the UI Kit, or to add an icon to the Kaizen Component Library, Culture Amp employees can see an [internal link for the icons process on our wiki](https://cultureamp.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/Prod/pages/154211094/Icon+Process).

## Using icons in components

- To display icons that do not have actions associated with them, use the [Icon](/components/icon) component.
- For clickable icons that perform actions, use an [Icon Button](/components/icon-button).

## To keep in mind

Icons are a visual aid or cue. They guide user where to go or what to do. They communicate the core intent of an action. Emotionally, users may prefer pictures, but comprehension is lower. Finally, icons give a sense of personality.

- By default, icons are 20px in size (minimum) and can be scaled to larger sizes if it contextually makes sense.
- Maintain a minimum touch target of 48px where appropriate.
- For spacing between an icon and its label, use 10px.

Positioning and location:

- Use icons next to control actions (e.g. Export, Print etc.).
- Conceptually, icons always need a label (screen reader, title tag, alt tag, tooltips).
- Icons can be used as illustrations (e.g. Drag & Drop).
- Use icons to trigger tooltips for information.
