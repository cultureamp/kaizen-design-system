  Icons are a helpful and familiar visual aid to guide and inform users. Not just for aesthetics, they provide humanity by defining hierarchy for information and shaping a page’s composition, helping to make our product more approachable and usable.

  See our <Link to="/components/Icon">Icon Component</Link> for information about how to use these components.

* by default, by 20px in size (minimum) and can be scaled to larger sizes if it contextually makes sense.

* have a minimum touch zone of 48px

* be accompanied by a label to support the visual. Try avoid using icons in isolation of labels, unless they are being used for a clear visual convention (e.g. Search, Home, Close, etc.)

<TipCard title="Icons should not…" type="warning"> -->

## Icons should not...
