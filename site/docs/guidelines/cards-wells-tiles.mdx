## When to use each component

* For content that requires an active bounding area, use a [Card](/components/card).
* For content that requires boundaries to define or contextualize content. [Wells](/components/well) can provide a way to do this visually.
* For content that has a single focus and includes visual content and actions, use a [Tile](/components/tile).
