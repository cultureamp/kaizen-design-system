## When to use

* For content that requires an active bounding area, use a [Card](https://drive.google.com/a/cultureamp.com/open?id=1ErRhNAZsOSx4gHV1TCUuaZoK9v16ytN_XKkjElOfnNo).
* For content that requires boundaries to define or contextualise content. [Wells](https://drive.google.com/a/cultureamp.com/open?id=1DQyj5tltlbyRANV0bt2ZENKUWWXd5Qu9iCF1mTku3LA) can provide a way to do this visually.
* For content that has a single focus and includes visual content and actions, use a [Tile](https://drive.google.com/a/cultureamp.com/open?id=1y1IpvQjK8kkmy8E8PiA3Jj6i0gKc_phXYrw8kRTM3uc).
