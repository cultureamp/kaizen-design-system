summaryParagraph: Culture Amp customers have diverse, globally distributed employees that speak many languages. We localize our interfaces as well as our surveys and other data. These guidelines focus on interface localization.

needToKnow:
  - 'Use the "dir" global attribute to indicate the directionality of text. For example, set it "rtl" for right-to-left languages.'
  - 'Use flex "start" and "end" instead of "left" and right".'

## Overview

As Culture Amp's products grow, we need to support many more languages. Localizing interfaces includes translating text. Sometimes, this means supporting different directional layouts, such as supporting right-to-left (RTL) text in Arabic and Hebrew.

Start thinking about the horizontal flow of a layout in terms of `start` and `end` as opposed to `left` and `right`. This will help you determine where you need to cater for RTL layout support. CSS [Flexbox](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Flexible_Box_Layout/Basic_Concepts_of_Flexbox) takes this approach and uses `flex-start` and `flex-end` for positioning elements within a flex container. Wherever possible, start using flexbox for your layout to get a lot of RTL support for free!

## Getting Started

Culture Amp has a number of [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) mixins that are available from Kaizen. To use them, you will need to import the correct mixin file.

## Text Alignment

If you explicitly need to set the `text-align` property for your document or component, use the `ca-type-align-start` or `ca-type-align-end` mixin as follows. As an example, using `ca-type-align-start` in a left-to-right layout will result in left-aligned text, whereas in a right-to-left layout, the resulting text will be right-aligned.

### Available Mixins

| Name                | Description                                                   |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ca-type-align-start | left-aligned text in **LTR** or right-aligned text in **RTL** |
| ca-type-align-end   | right-aligned text in **LTR** or left-aligned text in **RTL** |

## Margins/Padding/Position

When using any `left` or `right`-specific CSS properties e.g. `margin-left`, `padding-left`, `left`, and so on, it is common to need these values 'flipped' in an RTL layout:

<!--- <InlineNotification persistent={true} type="informative">**Note:** These mixins also take a `$top` and `$bottom` value. While these values are never 'flipped', they can be supplied to the mixin, which will avoid any CSS rules being overwritten.</InlineNotification> --->

### Margins

Note: all params are optional.

| Name      | Value                       |
| --------- | --------------------------- |
| `$top`    | any valid CSS size and unit |
| `$bottom` | any valid CSS size and unit |
| `$start`  | any valid CSS size and unit |
| `$end`    | any valid CSS size and unit |

### Padding

<CAPaddingExample />

Note: all params are optional.

| Name      | Value                       |
| --------- | --------------------------- |
| `$top`    | any valid CSS size and unit |
| `$bottom` | any valid CSS size and unit |
| `$start`  | any valid CSS size and unit |
| `$end`    | any valid CSS size and unit |

### Position

This mixin is relevant to `absolute` or `relative`-positioned elements.

<CAPositionExample />

Note: all params are optional.

| Name      | Value                       |
| --------- | --------------------------- |
| `$top`    | any valid CSS size and unit |
| `$bottom` | any valid CSS size and unit |
| `$start`  | any valid CSS size and unit |
| `$end`    | any valid CSS size and unit |

## Buttons

A chevron icon or "angle bracket" before or after the text in a button label shows which direction in the process the user’s click on the button will take them. The “backward” and “forward” directions for arrows are dependent on the writing direction (specifically, they are reversed in right-to-left writing systems).

## Testing RTL layout support

Set the `dir` attribute on any parent element to `"rtl"`.
