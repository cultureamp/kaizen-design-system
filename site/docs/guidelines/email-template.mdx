There are two types of product emails:
- Culture Amp system emails
  - E.g. The system inviting Mackenzie to onboard.
  - These can show a bit more brand personality.
  - The default background colour should be Purple 100.
  - The colour can change depending on mood, for example:
    - Use Green 100 if sending emails that celebrate an achievement, e.g. setting up an account for the first time, or confirming that a user has completed a performance review cycle.
    - Use Orange 100 if the user is facing a time-sensitive moment, e.g. a performance review feedback cycle deadline is about to close, or a company engagement survey is about to close).
- Account communications
  - E.g. Mackenzie sending an org-wide survey invite.
  - These are more neutral as they come from the customer.
  - The default background colour should be Gray 100.
  - Only one CTA per email.
  - Stick to the prescribed template - don’t change fonts/colours.
  - Any content in this email needs to be responsive. See Keep in mind for responsive guidance.

## Anatomy

A standard Email template will include the following:

**Preheader**

Preheaders are visible in the inbox preview and body of the email. They add useful context to your subject line and can help to increase open rates. Keep them short (between 40-70 characters) and to the point.

**Subject line**
* The subject line should be informational and concise.
* 7 words and 41 characters are optimal.
* Limit exclamation marks to a maximum of one per message. Instead, use well-chosen words to convey the meaning.
* Limit emoji to one per subject line and make sure it's well-considered and the meaning is easy to interpret. It should add meaning rather than be decorative.
* Don’t use an emoji and an exclamation mark in the same subject line.

**Background colors**
* Use Gray 100 for Account communications
* Use Purple 100 (by default) for Culture Amp System communications, or alternatively use a mood to define the sentiment of the email, e.g. Green 100 for a positive email

**Logo**
* Use the Culture Amp logo for systems emails.
* Use the Customer logo for account communications.
    * Customer logo presented contained on white background (same as in platform).

**Header**
* Try keep the header concise - a maximum of two lines for desktop.
* Header length should not be any wider than the body container, i.e. 600px.

**Body**
* Illustration (optional)
    * Include Alt text for accessibility.
* Body copy
    * Single column only.
* Call to action (optional)
    * Single primary button (Blue 100) only.

**Footer**
* Powered by Culture Amp Logo
    * Logo
    * Tagline: The Employee Experience Platform
* Secondary links
    * Privacy, Support, View in browser
    * These links are deliberately subdued, i.e. not Blue 500
* Divider
* Secondary information, e.g. Legal text
