- [Loading skeleton](/components/loading-skeleton): A collection of loading placeholders that display a non-interactive preview of the app’s actual UI to visually communicate that content is in the process of loading.
    - [Loading skeleton](/components/loading-skeleton): A single loading placeholder element used in a loading skeleton to visually communicate that piece of content.
- [Loading spinner](/components/loading-spinner): An animated element that indicates loading is in process and where it will appear when loading data is slow.

## When to use each component

*   For more than 1 element loading at the same time that requires an indicator, use a [loading skeleton](/components/loading-skeleton).
*   For high-traffic pages like our account dashboard, use a [loading skeleton](/components/loading-skeleton).
*   When a [loading spinner](/components/loading-spinner) is not prominent enough, use a [loading skeleton](/components/loading-skeleton).
*   When data takes more than 300ms to load on an average connection for our user base, use a [loading skeleton](/components/loading-skeleton).
*   For a long-running process or background process, e.g. importing data or exporting reports, use a [progress bar](/components/progress-bar).
*   For fast processes that take less than 300ms, consider a [loading spinner](/components/loading-spinner) or no loading state at all.
*   For a tiny, inline action or feedback, e.g. clicked a button and the action will take time, use a [loading spinner](/components/loading-spinner).
*   For low-traffic pages such as super-user only admin pages, use a [loading spinner](/components/loading-spinner).
*   If a page refresh is required, use an empty state with a Call To Action to refresh.
*   For introducing content with flair, use a choreographed or stylized entrance. In contrast to a [loading skeleton](/components/loading-skeleton), choreographed or stylized entrances don’t care how long content takes to load. For example, the whole page might be loaded already, but we only reveal each section with a fade as the person scrolls down the page. A single stylized entrance may mask and replace a [loading spinner](/components/loading-spinner).
