- [Loading skeleton](/components/loading-skeleton): A collection of loading placeholders that display a non-interactive preview of the appâ€™s actual UI to visually communicate that content is in the process of loading.
    - [Loading placeholder](/components/loading-placeholder): A single loading placeholder element used in a loading skeleton to visually communicate that piece of content.
- [Loading spinner](/components/loading-spinner): An animated element that indicates loading is in process and where it will appear when loading data is slow.

## When to use each component

**Use a [loading skeleton](/components/loading-skeleton):**
*   for more than 1 element loading at the same time that requires an indicator.
*   for high-traffic pages like our account dashboard.
*   when a loading spinner is not prominent enough.
*   when data takes more than 300ms to load on an average connection for our user base.
*   for introducing content with flair, applying a choreographed or stylized entrance. 

**Use a [loading spinner](/components/loading-spinner):**
*   for fast processes that take less than 300ms, consider a loading spinner or no loading state at all.
*   for a tiny, inline action or feedback, e.g. a clicked button and the action will take time, use a button with a [working state](/guidelines/interaction-states/#working-state)
*   for low-traffic pages such as super-user only admin pages.

**Use a [progress bar](/components/progress-bar):**
*   for a long-running process or background process, e.g. importing data or exporting reports.
