## Palette

<ColorShowcase />

## Best practices

### Colors should...

- Add value to the page

- Use more than colour alone to convey information (Be mindful of color blind / greyscale users)

- Be mindful of color psychology values (e.g. Red is danger/bad/stop) vs cultural values

### Colors shouldn't...

- Be overused.

- Create a ‘candy shop’ effect

- Overload the user and create confusion
