## To keep in mind

- Contrast and accessibility is crucial. To [consider everyone](/language/voiceandtone/), we use color contrast ratios that adhered to [WCAG 2.1 AA](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#contrast-minimum) guidelines.
- Use our official color palette variables for all color CSS declarations.
- Use `rgba()` to add transparency to a color, e.g. `rgba($kz-var-color-purple-800-rgb-params, 0.7)`.
- Please avoid using the deprecated custom helper `add-alpha()`, as it requires importing a deprecated module and will not break the build when it is missing.
- Be mindful of color psychology associations and cultural values (such as red symbolizing danger versus good luck).

### Links

To indicate links and on-page actions, use Blue 500.

### Primary action

For the most important action on a page, use Blue 500 or Green 400 as the Primary button color on our Default Header (Purple 600 background).

### Data visualization

See [data visualization](/guidelines/data-visualization) for details.

- For favorable scores and general positive colored graphs and visualizations, use Data Viz / Favorable `$kz-var-id-data-viz-favorable`
- For unfavorable scores and general negative colored graphs and visualizations, use Data Viz / Unfavorable `$kz-var-id-data-viz-unfavorable`

## When to use and when not to use

<WhenToUseAndWhenNotToUse>
<WhenToUse>

- Colors can help to create visual patterns that the user can recall (for example, links are always Blue colored or negative favorability scores, errors, and destructive actions are always Red).
- Use colors to create visual hierarchy.
- Colors can help to determine the level of severity.
- Add tone and contrast to define areas and guide or call out certain information.
- Use color for aesthetics or visual stimulation when it adds value to the page.

</WhenToUse>
<WhenNotToUse>

- Use more than color alone to convey information. Test with with a gray scale filter and color blindness simulators.
- Avoid using color when you can use contrast (such as levels of Purple or Neutrals), spacing, or typography to create hierarchy or groupings.
- Avoid color when there’s a risk of overuse or a ‘candy shop’ effect.
- Avoid color when it might overload the user and create confusion.
