## Zen palette

These color design tokens can be used in Sass or JavaScript. See the [design tokens package](https://github.com/cultureamp/kaizen-design-system/tree/master/packages/design-tokens).

### Neutrals

White is used for text and icons on dark backgrounds. Stone is used for the product's canvas. Ash is primarily used for Wells (Empty States).

<ZenNeutrals />

### Wisteria

Used for dark text (Wisteria 800), content header background and status tags.

<ZenWisteria />

### Cluny

Used for links (Cluny 500), control actions, guidance and onboarding.

<ZenCluny />

### Seedling

Used for Calls To Action (CTAs) and positive moods (e.g. success messages, status, progress).

<ZenSeedling />

### Yuzu

Used for highlighting Collective Intelligence assets and cautionary moods (e.g. warning messages, progress).

<ZenYuzu />

### Peach

## To keep in mind

- Contrast and accessibility is crucial. To [consider everyone](/language/voiceandtone/), we use color contrast ratios that adhered to [WCAG 2.0 AA](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/#visual-audio-contrast-contrast) guidelines.
- Use our official color palette variables for all color CSS declarations.
- Use `rgba()` to add transparency to a color, e.g. `rgba($kz-var-color-wisteria-800-rgb-params, 0.8)`.
- Please avoid using the deprecated custom helper `add-alpha()`, as it requires importing a deprecated module and will not break the build when it is missing.
- Be mindful of color psychology associations and cultural values (such as red symbolizing danger versus good luck).

### Links

To indicate links and on-page actions, use Cluny.

### Primary action

For the most important action on a page, use Cluny (or Seedling on dark backgrounds).

### Data visualization

See [data visualization](/guidelines/data-visualization) for details.

### Accessibility tools

The preferred option for handling accessibility in relation to colors is to use contrasting colors that won't cause confusion as our defaults. Sometimes this isn't possible, and in that case other indicators such as stripes over data colors can help create this distinction.

Some defaults and helper methods are available for scss.

## When to use and when not to use

<WhenToUseAndWhenNotToUse>
<WhenToUse>

- Colors can help to create visual patterns that the user can recall (for example, links are always Cluny colored or negative favorability scores, errors, and destructive actions are always Coral).
- Use colors to create visual hierarchy.
- Colors can help to determine the level of severity.
- Add tone and contrast to define areas and guide or call out certain information.
- Use color for aesthetics or visual stimulation when it adds value to the page.

</WhenToUse>
<WhenNotToUse>

- Use more than color alone to convey information. Test with with a gray scale filter and color blindness simulators.
- Avoid using color when you can use contrast (such as levels of Wisteria or Neutrals), spacing, or typography to create hierarchy or groupings.
- Avoid color when there’s a risk of overuse or a ‘candy shop’ effect.
- Avoid color when it might overload the user and create confusion.
