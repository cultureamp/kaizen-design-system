needToKnow:
  - Use official color palette colors, variables and helpers (add-alpha) for all color CSS declarations. Never hard-code a color without a variable.
  - Use add-alpha (to add transparency) when the color needs to blend with different backgrounds.

## Zen palette

These color design tokens can be used in Sass or JavaScript. See the [design tokens package for details](https://github.com/cultureamp/kaizen-design-system/tree/master/packages/design-tokens).

### Neutrals

White is used for text and icons on dark backgrounds. Stone is used for the product's canvas. Ash is primarily used for Wells (Empty States).

## To keep in mind

- Contrast and accessibility is crucial. To [consider everyone](../language#culture-amp-brand-tone-and-design-principles), we use color contrast ratios that adhered to [WCAG 2.0 AA](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/#visual-audio-contrast-contrast) guidelines.
- Use our official color palette variables and helpers (`add-alpha`) for all color CSS declarations.
- Use tints (to add white) and shades (to add black) to a base color in increments of 10% to define the appropriate perceived lightness or darkness of a color. You might need 5% steps at the lighter end of the range.
- Be mindful of color psychology associations and cultural values (such as Red symbolizing danger versus good luck).

### Links

To indicate links and on-page actions, use Ocean.

### Primary action

For the most important action on a page, use Seedling.

### Data visualization

To indicate Sentiment, use:

- Seedling + 50% tint for Positive sentiment.
- Ink + 93% tint for Neutral sentiment.
- Coral + 70% tint for Negative sentiment.



## When to use

- Colors can help to create visual patterns that the user can recall (for example, links are always Ocean colored or negative favorability scores, errors, and destructive actions are always Coral).
- Use colors to create visual hierarchy.
- Colors can help to determine the level of severity.
- Add tone and contrast to define areas and guide or call out certain information.
- Use color for aesthetics or visual stimulation when it adds value to the page.



## When not to use

- Use more than color alone to convey information. Test with with a gray scale filter and color blindness simulators.
- Avoid using color when you can use contrast (such as tints and shades of ink), spacing, or typography to create hierarchy or groupings.
- Avoid color when there’s a risk of overuse or a ‘candy shop’ effect.
- Avoid color when it might overload the user and create confusion.
