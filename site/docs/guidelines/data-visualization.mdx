## To keep in mind

Charts, diagrams, and hero data draw attention to insights and help people make sense of complex information. They provide answers to questions that people can act on.

- Test with real data. For example, test with one or two data points as well as hundreds and test low and high numbers.
- Answer one question at a time. Avoid overloading charts with information to solve multiple problems.
- Provide "Overview first, zoom and filter, then details-on-demand". Read more in [3 rules for Interactive data visualization by Vlad Kozhevnikov](https://towardsdatascience.com/3-rules-for-interactive-data-visualizations-a-showcase-with-r-and-highcharts-e452f5c37f44).

## Line charts

<iframe style="border: none;" width="744" height="450" src="https://www.figma.com/embed?embed_host=share&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.figma.com%2Ffile%2Fe3TyAOZKfLg9cA01Iy1Mgm%2FKaizen-Site-embed%3Fnode-id%3D40863%253A459&chrome=DOCUMENTATION" allowfullscreen></iframe>

We primarily use line charts to show trend over time. They can be used to show distribution and comparisons too. A line chart shows the evolution of one or several variables, such as favorability, with quantitative values, such as 75%, over a continuous interval or time period, such as 3 years.

- **Avoid overplotting**, which can lead to a crowded [spaghetti plot](https://www.data-to-viz.com/caveat/spaghetti.html).
- **Avoid misleading curves** between points, as described in [Let’s Chart: stop those lying line charts by Noah Lorang](https://m.signalvnoise.com/lets-chart-stop-those-lying-line-charts/).
- **Show visible dots** for each data point to clarify when data was measured on a line. You may need to avoid showing the individual dots if there are so many that it becomes crowded.
- **Use solid lines for primary data** and dotted lines for reference lines, such as predictions or benchmarks.

## Scatterplots and bubble charts

A scatterplot shows points on X and Y axes representing two quantitative variables while a bubble chart shows a third numeric variable using bubble size. They are used to show correlation and distribution. Sometimes color is used to show an additional variable, such as sentiment.

- For the size of bubbles, **scale the bubble area** and not its radius or diameter to the data.
- Use **transparent** points or bubbles if they overlap.
- **Readability** of point or bubble labels can be a challenge:
    - Label only the bubbles that tell the story. You might show the rest of the bubbles' labels on hover.
    - Truncate long labels e.g. with an ellipsis. You might show the rest of the label on hover.
    - Place the label in the center of the bubble.
    - Adjust font size according to bubble size. Again, you might show large text only on the bubbles that tell the story.
- Use a "line of best fit" or a "trend line" to **surface trends** in the data.

## Bar charts

Bar charts are used to compare discrete, numeric data across categories.

- Order the bars. For example, you might use natural data order, such as months of the year, or rank them, ordering the bars from shortest to longest.
- For long bar labels, consider using a horizontal bar chart or presenting the label on the bar.

We often used a stacked bar to represent likert scales.

## Hero data

<iframe style="border: none;" width="744" height="450" src="https://www.figma.com/embed?embed_host=share&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.figma.com%2Ffile%2Fe3TyAOZKfLg9cA01Iy1Mgm%2FKaizen-Site-embed%3Fnode-id%3D41211%253A0&chrome=DOCUMENTATION" allowfullscreen></iframe>

Hero data refers to prominent figures on a page that draw attention to individual values using proportionally larger type sizes. Use hero data to highlight a single value when it does not need context or comparisons.

- Show a number and unit label
- If you show an accompanying comparison indicator (such as an arrow) to indicate the direction the number is trending, provide further context elsewhere to describe the baseline it's compared to
- See [typography guidelines](/guidelines/typography) to learn more

- [Polaris: display metrics](https://polaris.shopify.com/design/data-visualizations#section-display-metrics)

## Color

To indicate Sentiment, use:

- Seedling 400 for Positive sentiment.
- Ash for Neutral sentiment.
- Coral 300 for Negative sentiment.

To learn more about using color, see [color guidelines](/guidelines/color).

## When to use and when not to use

<WhenToUseAndWhenNotToUse>
<WhenToUse>

- Use a data visualization to highlight interesting values.
- Use a data visualization to summarize data.
- Use a data visualization to solve valuable problems. Avoid using data visualization only for visual impact.

</WhenToUse>
<WhenNotToUse>

- Use a data [table](/components/table) when a summary or data visualization will be insufficient. For example, where every value needs to be seen.
