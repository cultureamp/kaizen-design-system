# Kaizen Site

## Getting started

`yarn gatsby develop`

Visit: <http://localhost:8000>.

Kaizen Site documentation is written using [Markdown syntax](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax).

Because pages contain "user-generated content" in Markdown, pay attention to styling across pages with different content. For example, broad CSS selectors might have unintended consequences on, for example, bold text in nested bullets or code examples.

To see storybook locally, you need to run that separately. See the main repo [README](../README.md). Storybook demos won't show on component pages.

## Managing plugins

To install [Gatsby plugins](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/plugins/):

```
yarn add -W <package>
```

## Troubleshooting

If Gatsby gets confused about Kaizen Site, try removing the `site/.cache`.

For storybook issues, see the main repo [README](../README.md).
